Ecco il file CSV con la classificazione richiesta.

Per la maggior parte delle voci, la classificazione si basa sulla concordanza tra titolo e abstract. In un caso specifico (**W00110**), il titolo descrive esplicitamente un metodo PINN per MREPT (MRI), mentre il testo dell'abstract fornito nella fonte descrive uno studio CT; in questo caso ho dato priorità alle informazioni esplicite contenute nel titolo.
