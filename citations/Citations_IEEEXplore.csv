MREPT is a noninvasive technique that can retrieve the spatial distribution of electrical properties (EPs) of scanned tissues from measured transmit radiofrequency (RF) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems. The reconstruction of EP values in MREPT is achieved by solving a partial differential equation derived from Maxwell’s equations that lacks a direct solution. Most conventional MREPT methods suffer from artifacts caused by the invalidation of the assumption applied for simplification of the problem and numerical errors caused by numerical differentiation. Existing deep learning-based (DL-based) MREPT methods comprise data-driven methods that need to collect massive datasets for training or model-driven methods that are only validated in trivial cases. Hence we proposed a model-driven method that learns mapping from a measured RF, its spatial gradient and Laplacian to EPs using fully connected networks (FCNNs). The spatial gradient of EP can be computed through the automatic differentiation of FCNNs and the chain rule. FCNNs are optimized using the residual of the central physical equation of convection-reaction MREPT as the loss function ( ${{\mathcal {L}}}{)}$ . To alleviate the ill condition of the problem, we added multiconstraints, including the similarity constraint between permittivity and conductivity and the  ${\ell }_{{{1}}}$  norm of spatial gradients of permittivity and conductivity, to the  ${{\mathcal {L}}}$ . We demonstrate the proposed method with a three-dimensional realistic head model, a digital phantom simulation, and a practical phantom experiment at a 9.4T animal MRI system.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2024.3391651","Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018B030333001); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62301351); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10506078","Electrical properties tomography;physics-informed neural network;automatic differentiation, multiconstraints","Mathematical models;Magnetic resonance imaging;Radio frequency;Image reconstruction;Graphical models;Distribution functions;Permittivity","Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Phantoms, Imaging;Neural Networks, Computer;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Tomography;Animals;Algorithms","7","","47","IEEE","19 Apr 2024","Sept. 2024","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Methods: Utilising knowledge about the underlying physics, a novel network architecture (SH-Net) is introduced which involves the estimation of spherical harmonic coefficients to guarantee a spatially smooth field map estimate. The SH-Net is integrated in an end-to-end trainable model which jointly estimates the $B_{0}$-field map as well as the image. Experiments were conducted on retrospectively simulated low-field data of human knees. Results: We compare our model to different model-based approaches at distinct noise levels and various $B_{0}$-field distributions. Our results show that our physics-informed neural network approach outperforms the purely model-based methods by improving the PSNR up to 11.7% and the RMSE up to 86.3%.

We demonstrated the efficacy of PIFON-EPT through several simulated experiments at 3 and 7 T (T) MR imaging, and showed that our method can reconstruct physically consistent EP and transmit fields. Specifically, when only 20% of the noisy measured fields were used as inputs, PIFON-EPT reconstructed the EP of a phantom with $\leq 5\%$ error, and denoised and completed the measurements with $\leq 1\%$ error. Additionally, we adapted PIFON-EPT to solve the generalized Helmholtz equation that accounts for gradients of EP between inhomogeneities.

Recently, deep neural networks have been applied to reconstruct undersampled k-space data and have shown improved reconstruction performance. While most of these methods focus on designing novel reconstruction networks or new training strategies for a given undersampling pattern, e.g., Cartesian undersampling or Non-Cartesian sampling, to date, there is limited research aiming to learn and optimize k-space sampling strategies using deep neural networks. This work proposes a novel optimization framework to learn k-space sampling trajectories by considering it as an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) problem that can be solved using neural ODE. In particular, the sampling of k-space data is framed as a dynamic system, in which neural ODE is formulated to approximate the system with additional constraints on MRI physics. In addition, we have also demonstrated that trajectory optimization and image reconstruction can be learned collaboratively for improved imaging efficiency and reconstruction performance.

Magnetic Resonance Electrical Property Tomography (MREPT) relies on numerical differentiation to solve the partial differential equations (PDEs) to reconstruct electrical properties. However, the numerical differentiation for derivatives produces artifacts near tissue edges and amplifies noise. In this work, Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), are employed to estimate derivatives for MREPT with automatic differentiation enabled by neural networks to improve noise robustness and reduce edge artifacts. PINNs require the balance of various loss functions and information from collocation points of ground truth and image boundary to learn to estimate the derivatives. In this work, a warm-up mechanism is used to reduce the complexity of the multiple loss balance. Results showed that even with only three collocation points and boundary conditions, reconstructions can be made from noise-contaminated source images (SNR 50). This proves that PINNs achieved noise-robust estimate of partial derivatives, thus leding to noise-robust conductivity reconstruction.","","978-9-4639-6-8058","10.23919/AT-AP-RASC54737.2022.9814346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9814346","","Training;Image edge detection;Neural networks;Magnetic resonance;Tomography;Conductivity;Noise robustness","","6","","13","","6 Jul 2022","30 May-4 June 2022","30 May-4 June 2022","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we put forth a physics-informed deep learning framework that augments sparse clinical measurements with one-dimensional (1D) reduced-order model (ROM) simulations to generate physically consistent brain hemodynamic parameters with high spatiotemporal resolution. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound is one of the most common techniques in the current clinical workflow that enables noninvasive and instantaneous evaluation of blood flow velocity within the cerebral arteries. However, it is spatially limited to only a handful of locations across the cerebrovasculature due to the constrained accessibility through the skull’s acoustic windows. Our deep learning framework uses in vivo real-time TCD velocity measurements at several locations in the brain combined with baseline vessel cross-sectional areas acquired from 3D angiography images and provides high-resolution maps of velocity, area, and pressure in the entire brain vasculature. We validate the predictions of our model against in vivo velocity measurements obtained via four-dimensional (4D) flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. We then showcase the clinical significance of this technique in diagnosing cerebral vasospasm (CVS) by successfully predicting the changes in vasospastic local vessel diameters based on corresponding sparse velocity measurements. We show this capability by generating synthetic blood flow data after cerebral vasospasm at various levels of stenosis. Here, we demonstrate that the physics-based deep learning approach can estimate and quantify the subject-specific cerebral hemodynamic variables with high accuracy despite lacking knowledge of inlet and outlet boundary conditions, which is a significant limitation for the accuracy of the conventional purely physics-based computational models.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2022.3161653","National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)(grant numbers:R03NS108167); National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) Trailblazer(grant numbers:R21EB032187); University of Arizona’s 18th Mile TRIF Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9740143","Deep neural networks;brain hemodynamics;transcranial Doppler ultrasound;4D flow MRI","Magnetic resonance imaging;Hemodynamics;Computational modeling;Brain modeling;Blood;Velocity measurement;Arteries","Blood Flow Velocity;Brain;Cerebrovascular Circulation;Hemodynamics;Humans;Neural Networks, Computer;Physics;Ultrasonography, Doppler, Transcranial;Vasospasm, Intracranial","91","","71","IEEE","23 Mar 2022","Sept. 2022","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These models require densely sampled q-t space data for microstructural fitting, leading to very time-consuming acquisition protocols. To overcome this problem, we present a joint q-t space model–tDKI-Net to estimate diffusion-time dependent kurtosis and the transmembrane exchange, using downsampled q-t space data. The tDKI-Net is composed of several q-Encoders and a t-Encoder, designed based on the extragradient mechanism, each integrated with their respective mapping networks. In the tDKI-Net, two types of encoders along with their mapping networks are employed sequentially to generate kurtosis at individual diffusion times and to fit the transmembrane exchange time ($\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\boldsymbol{m}}$) using the time-dependent kurtosis according to the Kärger's model. Meanwhile, we proposed a three-stage training strategy, including physics-informed self-supervised pretraining, DKI warm-up, and joint training, to match the network structure. Our results demonstrated that the proposed tDKI-Net could effectively accelerate tDKI scans, resulting in lower estimation error compared with other methods. Our proposed three-stage training strategy demonstrated superior results than those training from scratch, e.g., the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of $\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\boldsymbol{m}}$ decreased by up to 1.4%. We also investigated the training data size effects and found that although we used one-subject training, the network achieved lower NRMSEs for $\bm {K}_{\text {avg}}$, $\bm {K}_{\bm {0}}$ and $\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\boldsymbol{m}}$ (2.50%, 3.04%, 10.86%) than previous work that used three-subject training (3.8%, 9.5%, 12.1%). tDKI-Net can considerably reduce the scan time by 10.5-fold by joint downsampling the q-t space data without compromising the estimation accuracy.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2024.3417259","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:81971606,82122032); Science and Technology Department of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:2022C03057,202006140); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10568339","  $q-t$   space learning;time-dependent diffusion magnetic resonance imaging;quantitative magnetic resonance imaging;  $t$  DKI","Kurtosis;Fitting;Training;Dictionaries;Data models;Magnetic resonance imaging;Estimation error","Humans;Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Brain;Algorithms;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Neural Networks, Computer","1","","49","IEEE","21 Jun 2024","Dec. 2024","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) has emerged as a promising lung imaging technique due to its non-invasiveness, portability, and capability for real-time imaging. However, existing EIT reconstruction methods still face significant challenges in achieving high imaging resolution and maintaining physical consistency. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a high-resolution lung imaging method based on an enhanced physics-informed neural network (PINN) integrated with EIT. The proposed framework utilizes ResNet34 as its backbone and incorporates the EIT partial differential equation (PDE) as a physical constraint, forming a dual-network architecture consisting of a voltage distribution prediction network (V-Net) and a conductivity distribution prediction network (σ-Net). Furthermore, a realistic three-dimensional thorax-lung model is constructed from clinical CT data to generate diverse simulated datasets, thereby supporting both data-abundant and data-limited scenarios. Extensive simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior imaging performance, with structural similarity index (SSIM) values consistently exceeding 0.86 and relative error (RE) below 0.27, even in challenging pathological conditions. The results highlight the model’s robustness and accuracy in accurately reconstructing both normal and injured lung tissues, indicating significant potential for clinical pulmonary monitoring and early disease detection.","2832-4234","979-8-3315-9730-6","10.1109/IST66504.2025.11268361","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11268361","Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN);electrical impedance tomography (EIT);thorax and lungs modeling;lung imaging;high-resolution","Electrical impedance tomography;Solid modeling;Lungs;Neural networks;Imaging;Reconstruction algorithms;Real-time systems;Robustness;Monitoring;Diseases","","","","18","IEEE","3 Dec 2025","15-17 Oct. 2025","15-17 Oct. 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The state-of-the-art SWE methods rely on the measurement of local shear wave speeds to infer material parameters and suffer from wave diffraction when applied to soft materials with strong heterogeneity. In the present study, we overcome this challenge by proposing a physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based SWE (SWENet) method. The spatial variation of elastic properties of inhomogeneous materials has been introduced in the governing equations, which are encoded in SWENet as loss functions. Snapshots of wave motions have been used to train neural networks, and during this course, the elastic properties within a region of interest illuminated by shear waves are inferred simultaneously. We performed finite element simulations, tissue-mimicking phantom experiments, and ex vivo experiments to validate the method. Our results show that the shear moduli of soft composites consisting of matrix and inclusions of several millimeters in cross-section dimensions with either regular or irregular geometries can be identified with excellent accuracy. The advantages of the SWENet over conventional SWE methods consist of using more features of the wave motions and enabling seamless integration of multi-source data in the inverse analysis. Given the advantages of SWENet, it may find broad applications where full wave fields get involved to infer heterogeneous mechanical properties, such as identifying small solid tumors with ultrasound SWE, and differentiating gray and white matters of the brain with magnetic resonance elastography.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2023.3338178","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Peking University; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11972206,11921002,11572179); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10336831","Shear wave elastography;deep learning;physics-informed neural network;inverse problem;phantom and ex vivo experiments;tumor biomechanics","Artificial neural networks;Phantoms;Training;Mathematical models;Elastography;Biological tissues;Biological neural networks","Elasticity Imaging Techniques;Ultrasonography;Physics;Neural Networks, Computer;Brain","27","","47","IEEE","30 Nov 2023","April 2024","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Common types include pituitary tumors, meningiomas, and gliomas. Motor skills, vision, and cognitive functions are major symptoms, that vary depending on the tumor's size and location. Early detection of tumors is highly crucial for effective treatment. In recent years, various deep learning techniques have been proposed, however, they face challenges in terms of higher error rates. To overcome the issue, this paper proposes a Parallel Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Skill Optimization Algorithm (2PINN-SOpt) for brain tumor classification and diagnosis. The proposed work has been experimented with using the Figshare dataset, and the image quality is improved by pre-processing with the Adaptive bilateral Texture Filter (AbTF). Features are extracted using DenseNet201 (D201), Geometric Algebra Transformer, and Parallel physicsInformed neural Networks (GAT-2PINet). Lastly, to improve accuracy, the 2PINNet weight parameter is changed using the Skill Optimization Algorithm (SOA) approach. Compared to alternative approaches, the suggested solution has an outstanding $\mathbf{9 9. 9 \%}$ recall and $\mathbf{9 9. 8 \%}$ accuracy. 2PINN-SOpt has two benefits over other models: it has a reduced false positive rate and is more accurate at recognizing complex brain tumor traits. Because handling large volumes of medical data is so simple, it is a particularly useful tool for practical usage in brain tumor screening.","","979-8-3315-1308-5","10.1109/NMITCON65824.2025.11187897","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11187897","Adaptive bilateral Texture Filter;Brain tumor detection;Geometric Algebra Transformer;Skill Optimization Algorithm;Parallel Physics-Informed Neural Networks","Adaptation models;Accuracy;Computational modeling;Brain tumors;Filtering algorithms;Brain modeling;Feature extraction;Transformers;Optimization;Biological neural networks","","","","16","IEEE","10 Oct 2025","1-2 Aug. 2025","1-2 Aug. 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Compressed Sensing (CS) and Deep Learning (DL) have emerged as the two leading paradigms for accelerating MRI by reconstructing images from undersampled k -space data. While large-scale DL models are often considered state-of-the-art, the profound impact of the k-space sampling strategy on reconstruction quality is not always fully interrogated. This research directly investigates this interplay by evaluating a classical Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) against a custom-developed, baseline U-Net CNN across three diverse public MRI datasets. We test four distinct undersampling masks—from standard Cartesian to advanced variable-density and edge-enhanced patterns. Our findings reveal a compelling and nuanced outcome: the ISTA algorithm, when paired with a physics-informed sampling mask, consistently and significantly outperforms our CNN baseline, particularly in a “zero-shot” or data-limited training scenario. On a benchmark knee dataset, ISTA achieved a PSNR over 40 dB, a result the CNN failed to approach. This work concludes that the strategic design of the data acquisition process is a foundational, and in some cases dominant, factor in the success of accelerated MRI, demonstrating that a mathematically-grounded iterative method can surpass a baseline deep learning model when the underlying physics are respected.","","979-8-3315-5989-2","10.1109/SITA67914.2025.11273443","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11273443","Compressed Sensing;MRI;Deep Learning;Image Reconstruction;K-Space Sampling;Iterative Algorithms","Deep learning;Image quality;Training;Magnetic resonance imaging;Data acquisition;Switches;Iterative algorithms;Convolutional neural networks;Image reconstruction;Compressed sensing","","","","17","IEEE","9 Dec 2025","20-21 Oct. 2025","20-21 Oct. 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We present a novel way to train a Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) at the edge, while using high performance computing at the cloud, without transfer of sensitive data. This is achieved by assigning the data fitting (regression) loss to the edge where data is acquired, and the physics informed (residual) loss to the cloud where computational capabilities are ample. We find that naively optimizing two separate loss functions asynchronously at separate locations sometimes results in an accuracy drop compared to joint training, which is a problem commonly faced in continual learning. Applying Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), a continual learning technique, to the cloud side residual loss eliminates the accuracy gap. Our analysis shows that this is due to the larger correlation between the gradient of the residual loss and the gradient of the EWC loss. Overall, this method presents a useful way for individualized physics modeling at the edge while protecting data privacy.","2766-4465","979-8-3503-0026-0","10.1109/BioCAS58349.2023.10388623","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10388623","Cardiovascular monitoring;physics modelling;neural networks","Training;Data privacy;Correlation;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Fitting;Bridge circuits","","","","13","IEEE","18 Jan 2024","19-21 Oct. 2023","19-21 Oct. 2023","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years, the ability of neural networks (NNs) has been continuously explored and gradually applied in medical ultrasound imaging. However, NNs are known to relatively rely on training data. For cases outside of the data set, accurate results are not always available. By employing the approach of Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINN), the predicament of excessive dependence of NNs on training data has been largely mitigated. However, each instance of PINN can only target a specific input model.

Current FUS treatment systems rely on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), B-mode ultrasound imaging, or harmonic motion imaging for guidance. MRI has the advantage of quantitatively measuring temperature but the high cost and limited availability of MRI limit ultimate impact. An MR-compatible Ultrasound Through Transmission (UTT) system that can quantitatively assess tissue changes caused by temperature is being investigated as a replacement for the current standard of guidance. Two FUS 256-element transducers are mounted in a container with a sample placed at their coinciding geometric center. A FUS transmitter system is connected to the transmitter transducer, while a FUS research system samples the signal at the receiver transducer. A UTT protocol of 256 sequential single-element transmissions with reception on 256 elements is performed on three different samples: homogeneous gelatin phantoms, gelatin phantoms with attenuative inclusions, and porcine meat samples before and after thermal ablation. Hybrid Angular Spectrum (HAS) acoustic simulations are performed on the unheated gelatin samples segmented into regions with measured properties. Simulations are also done on the heated porcine sample segmented into regions with ablative temperatures based on MR temperature imaging. Measured UTT datasets are compared to HAS-predicted transmission data. Complex regression shows good agreement between the UTT-measured and HAS-predicted datasets. On homogeneous samples, the average complex correlation coefficient across all receiver elements is 0.8897. In 1 cm and 2 cm diameter inclusion samples, the correlation is 0.7994 and 0.6934, respectively. On the porcine meat sample, the pre-ablation average correlation is 0.6636, with a post-ablation average correlation of 0.6595. The data indicate that ablation of the tissue causes measurable changes in the received signal, but our simplified model is inadequate to capture the true tissue changes. Future work is investigating this discrepancy with more advanced modeling. The ultimate goal is to use physics-informed neural networks to predict tissue changes from the UTT received signal.","1948-5727","979-8-3315-2332-9","10.1109/IUS62464.2025.11201505","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11201505","Focused Ultrasound;Ultrasound Through Transmission;HIFU;Thermal Ablation;Tissue Characterization;Hybrid Angular Spectrum;Acoustic Simulation","Temperature measurement;Ultrasonic imaging;Transducers;Correlation;Temperature;Ultrasonic variables measurement;Transmitters;Magnetic resonance imaging;Receivers;Acoustics","","","","16","IEEE","20 Oct 2025","15-18 Sept. 2025","15-18 Sept. 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The EM field is a 3-D distribution, especially for horizontal magnetic dipoles. By analyzing the characteristics of the field, the azimuth angle  $\phi $  is extracted from the initial partial differential equations (PDEs); thus, the task is transferred into a 2-D issue about input parameters  $\rho $  and z. The singularity of dipole sources is addressed well by abstracting the background field. Each field component includes both the real part and imaginary part in a dissipative medium. Therefore, we train two sets of PINNs to solve for them, respectively, which greatly increases the accuracy of output results. The lost functions related to the soft boundary and hard boundary are deeply discussed, which leads to different accuracy and efficiency.

A preregistered Scopus search followed by strict quality appraisal yielded 85 peer-reviewed papers. Evidence shows that Mamba-enhanced networks have been applied to eleven tasks: regression, radiology-report generation, super-resolution, image translation, fusion, denoising, enhancement, reconstruction, segmentation, classification, and registration, with segmentation dominating the corpus. Fourteen imaging modalities are represented: MRI, computed tomography, dermoscopy, endoscopy, and fundus photography appear most frequently, confirming the architecture’s versatility across clinical domains. Mamba usually integrates with five patterns strategy. Convolution–Mamba hybrids remain the workhorse, while attention and diffusion-based variants lower GPU memory and sampling cost. Recurrence-augmented designs and specialised pairings with graph, spiking-neuron, or physics-informed modules address motion, temporal coherence, or energy efficiency. Despite these advances, studies converge on five critical limitations: 1) memory and computation overhead, 2) poor scalability to full 3-D volumes, 3) unmet real-time or bedside latency, 4) vulnerability to noise, low-dose, and sparse sampling, and 5) instability under respiratory or cardiac motion. Future work consistently points to: high-resolution 3-D pipelines that preserve Mamba’s linear complexity; aggressive model compression for edge deployment; robust domain generalisation with continual learning; tighter coupling with complementary deep-learning architectures to encode structural or physical priors; and data-efficient training that exploits weak labels and synthetic augmentation. Addressing these directions will translate Mamba from a promising sequence backbone into a reliable, resource-aware engine for diagnostic, interventional, and robotic imaging workflows.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3637778","Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia; Directorate General of Research and Development, Ministry of Higher Education, Science, and Technology for Penelitian Disertasi Doktor 2025 Scheme(grant numbers:070/C3/DT.05.00/PL/2025,PKS-529/UN2.RST/HKP.05.00/2025); Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education Republic Indonesia/Lembaga Pengelola Dana Pendidikan Republik Indonesia (LPDP RI)(grant numbers:LOG-19136/LPDP.3/2024); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11270883","Mamba;medical images;state space model;computer vision","Biomedical imaging;Transformers;Computational modeling;Accuracy;Deep learning;Training;Surveys;Scalability;Robustness;Imaging","","","","145","CCBY","27 Nov 2025","2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The involved sparsifying transformations or dictionaries are typically either pre-trained using a model which reflects the assumed properties of the signals or adaptively learned during the reconstruction - yielding so-called blind Compressed Sensing approaches. However, by doing so, the transforms are never explicitly trained in conjunction with the physical model which generates the signals. In addition, properly choosing the involved regularization parameters remains a challenging task. Another recently emerged training-paradigm for regularization methods is to use iterative neural networks (INNs) - also known as unrolled networks - which contain the physical model. In this work, we construct an INN which can be used as a supervised and physics-informed online convolutional dictionary learning algorithm. We evaluated the proposed approach by applying it to a realistic large-scale dynamic MR reconstruction problem and compared it to several other recently published works. We show that the proposed INN improves over two conventional model-agnostic training methods and yields competitive results also compared to a deep INN. Further, it does not require to choose the regularization parameters and - in contrast to deep INNs - each network component is entirely interpretable.","2076-1465","978-90-827970-9-1","10.23919/EUSIPCO55093.2022.9909604","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9909604","Iterative Neural Networks;Sparsity;Convolutional Dictionary Learning;Compressed Sensing;Cardiac Cine MRI","Training;Adaptation models;Dictionaries;Convolution;Magnetic resonance imaging;Neural networks;Machine learning","","4","","14","","18 Oct 2022","29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2022","29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2022","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The resulting chemical shift artifacts of conventional Cartesian sampling are well-defined, appearing as ‘ghost images’ along the readout direction. However, a key challenge with radial sampling is that frequency offsets lead to nonlinear smearing artifacts throughout the image. Thus, proper modeling of forward sensing operators is crucial, as the successful deconvolution of artifacts relies on the joint design of acquisition scheme and sampling pattern. In this work, we aim to address these perspectives through the lens of radial spectral deconvolution. Our goal is to develop suitable modeling of the radial chemical shift artifacts using Radon transform, which will guide our design of sensing operators that favor specific multi-spectral imaging tasks. To effectively unmix the component images under low SNR regime, we will further exploit physics-informed learning-based unrolling strategies that enable simultaneous artifact removal and weak signal detection, both of particular interest in 19F MRI. particular interest in 19 F MRI. 1","2576-2303","979-8-3503-2574-4","10.1109/IEEECONF59524.2023.10476927","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10476927","","Deconvolution;Multispectral imaging;Magnetic resonance imaging;Transforms;Sensors;Task analysis;Chemicals","","2","","23","IEEE","1 Apr 2024","29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2023","29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2023","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While high-resolution 3D imaging can provide valuable anatomical information, clinical acquisitions are often inadequate for reliable volumetric reconstruction due to unpredictable fetal motion and thick-slice protocols. Conventional iterative reconstruction methods, though effective, are computationally intensive and struggle with severe motion artifacts, limiting their feasibility in fast-paced clinical workflows. At the same time, the scarcity of authentic 3D fetal brain volumes prevents supervised learning approaches from developing generalizable reconstruction models. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SAFFRON, a physics-informed, label-free self-supervised framework for efficient and high-fidelity 3D fetal brain MRI reconstruction. SAFFRON eliminates the need for ground-truth 3D volumes by combining physics-driven slice acquisition modeling with data-driven deep learning, thereby bridging model-based and learning-based paradigms. The reconstruction task is decomposed into two modules: (1) multi-stack motion estimation via an SVR network that aligns slices into a canonical space, and (2) 3D volume reconstruction via an SRR network. Reconstruction quality is further enhanced by two targeted constraints: a stack-level contextual consistency loss to guide more accurate alignment and a slice-level adversarial loss to promote anatomically realistic structures. Extensive experiments on simulated and clinical datasets demonstrate that SAFFRON substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior reconstruction accuracy while delivering up to a 60× acceleration in processing speed.","1941-0484","","10.1109/JSTSP.2025.3637544","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11269688","fetal brain MRI;slice-to-volume image reconstruction;motion correction;self-supervised learning","Image reconstruction;Three-dimensional displays;Magnetic resonance imaging;Accuracy;Solid modeling;Motion estimation;Brain modeling;Training;Data models;Motion artifacts","","","","","IEEE","26 Nov 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"
