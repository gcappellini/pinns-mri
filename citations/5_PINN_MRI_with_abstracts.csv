Tracer-kinetic models allow for the quantification of kinetic parameters such as 
blood flow from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) images. 
Fitting the observed data with multi-compartment exchange models is desirable, 
as they are physiologically plausible and resolve directly for blood flow and 
microvascular function. However, the reliability of model fitting is limited by 
the low signal-to-noise ratio, temporal resolution, and acquisition length. This 
may result in inaccurate parameter estimates. This study introduces 
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) as a means to perform myocardial 
perfusion MR quantification, which provides a versatile scheme for the inference 
of kinetic parameters. These neural networks can be trained to fit the observed 
perfusion MR data while respecting the underlying physical conservation laws 
described by a multi-compartment exchange model. Here, we provide a framework 
for the implementation of PINNs in myocardial perfusion MR. The approach is 
validated both in silico and in vivo. In the in silico study, an overall 
decrease in mean-squared error with the ground-truth parameters was observed 
compared to a standard non-linear least squares fitting approach. The in vivo 
study demonstrates that the method produces parameter values comparable to those 
previously found in literature, as well as providing parameter maps which match 
the clinical diagnosis of patients.

Flow-Rate-Constrained Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Flow Field Error 
Correction in 4-D Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

Kang J, Jung EC, Koo HJ, Yang DH, Ha H.

In this study, we present enhanced physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), 
which were designed to address flow field errors in four-dimensional flow 
magnetic resonance imaging (4D Flow MRI). Flow field errors, typically occurring 
in high-velocity regions, lead to inaccuracies in velocity fields and flow rate 
underestimation. We proposed incorporating flow rate constraints to ensure 
physical consistency across cross-sections. The proposed framework included 
optimization strategies to improve convergence, stability, and accuracy. 
Artificial viscosity modeling, projecting conflicting gradients (PCGrad), and 
Euclidean norm scaling were applied to balance loss functions during training. 
The performance was validated using 2D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with 
synthetic error, in-vitro 4D flow MRI mimicking aortic valve, and in-vivo 4D 
flow MRI from patients with aortic regurgitation and aortic stenosis. This study 
demonstrated considerable improvements in correcting flow field errors, 
denoising, and super-resolution. Notably, the proposed PINNs provided accurate 
flow rate reconstruction in stenotic and high-velocity regions. This approach 
extends the applicability of 4D flow MRI by providing reliable hemodynamics in 
the post-processing stage.

Magnetic Resonance Electrical Properties Tomography Based on Modified Physics- 
Informed Neural Network and Multiconstraints.

Ruan G, Wang Z, Liu C, Xia L, Wang H, Qi L, Chen W.

This paper presents a novel method based on leveraging physics-informed neural 
networks for magnetic resonance electrical property tomography (MREPT). MREPT is 
a noninvasive technique that can retrieve the spatial distribution of electrical 
properties (EPs) of scanned tissues from measured transmit radiofrequency (RF) 
in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems. The reconstruction of EP values in 
MREPT is achieved by solving a partial differential equation derived from 
Maxwell's equations that lacks a direct solution. Most conventional MREPT 
methods suffer from artifacts caused by the invalidation of the assumption 
applied for simplification of the problem and numerical errors caused by 
numerical differentiation. Existing deep learning-based (DL-based) MREPT methods 
comprise data-driven methods that need to collect massive datasets for training 
or model-driven methods that are only validated in trivial cases. Hence we 
proposed a model-driven method that learns mapping from a measured RF, its 
spatial gradient and Laplacian to EPs using fully connected networks (FCNNs). 
The spatial gradient of EP can be computed through the automatic differentiation 
of FCNNs and the chain rule. FCNNs are optimized using the residual of the 
central physical equation of convection-reaction MREPT as the loss function ( L) 
. To alleviate the ill condition of the problem, we added multiconstraints, 
including the similarity constraint between permittivity and conductivity and 
the l1 norm of spatial gradients of permittivity and conductivity, to the L . We 
demonstrate the proposed method with a three-dimensional realistic head model, a 
digital phantom simulation, and a practical phantom experiment at a 9.4T animal 
MRI system.

Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Brain Hemodynamic Predictions Using Medical 
Imaging.

Sarabian M, Babaee H, Laksari K.

Determining brain hemodynamics plays a critical role in the diagnosis and 
treatment of various cerebrovascular diseases. In this work, we put forth a 
physics-informed deep learning framework that augments sparse clinical 
measurements with one-dimensional (1D) reduced-order model (ROM) simulations to 
generate physically consistent brain hemodynamic parameters with high 
spatiotemporal resolution. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound is one of the 
most common techniques in the current clinical workflow that enables noninvasive 
and instantaneous evaluation of blood flow velocity within the cerebral 
arteries. However, it is spatially limited to only a handful of locations across 
the cerebrovasculature due to the constrained accessibility through the skull's 
acoustic windows. Our deep learning framework uses in vivo real-time TCD 
velocity measurements at several locations in the brain combined with baseline 
vessel cross-sectional areas acquired from 3D angiography images and provides 
high-resolution maps of velocity, area, and pressure in the entire brain 
vasculature. We validate the predictions of our model against in vivo velocity 
measurements obtained via four-dimensional (4D) flow magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) scans. We then showcase the clinical significance of this technique in 
diagnosing cerebral vasospasm (CVS) by successfully predicting the changes in 
vasospastic local vessel diameters based on corresponding sparse velocity 
measurements. We show this capability by generating synthetic blood flow data 
after cerebral vasospasm at various levels of stenosis. Here, we demonstrate 
that the physics-based deep learning approach can estimate and quantify the 
subject-specific cerebral hemodynamic variables with high accuracy despite 
lacking knowledge of inlet and outlet boundary conditions, which is a 
significant limitation for the accuracy of the conventional purely physics-based 
computational models.

The diagnosis of heart failure usually includes a global functional assessment, 
such as ejection fraction measured by magnetic resonance imaging. However, these 
metrics have low discriminate power to distinguish different cardiomyopathies, 
which may not affect the global function of the heart. Quantifying local 
deformations in the form of cardiac strain can provide helpful information, but 
it remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce WarpPINN, a physics-informed 
neural network to perform image registration to obtain local metrics of heart 
deformation. We apply this method to cine magnetic resonance images to estimate 
the motion during the cardiac cycle. We inform our neural network of the 
near-incompressibility of cardiac tissue by penalizing the Jacobian of the 
deformation field. The loss function has two components: an intensity-based 
similarity term between the reference and the warped template images, and a 
regularizer that represents the hyperelastic behavior of the tissue. The 
architecture of the neural network allows us to easily compute the strain via 
automatic differentiation to assess cardiac activity. We use Fourier feature 
mappings to overcome the spectral bias of neural networks, allowing us to 
capture discontinuities in the strain field. The algorithm is tested on 
synthetic examples and on a cine SSFP MRI benchmark of 15 healthy volunteers, 
where it is trained to learn the deformation mapping of each case. We outperform 
current methodologies in landmark tracking and provide physiological strain 
estimations in the radial and circumferential directions. WarpPINN provides 
precise measurements of local cardiac deformations that can be used for a better 
diagnosis of heart failure and can be used for general image registration tasks.

PURPOSE: While the recommended analysis method for magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy data is linear combination model (LCM) fitting, the supervised deep 
learning (DL) approach for quantification of MR spectroscopy (MRS) and MR 
spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) data recently showed encouraging results; however, 
supervised learning requires ground truth fitted spectra, which is not 
practical. Moreover, this work investigates the feasibility and efficiency of 
the LCM-based self-supervised DL method for the analysis of MRS data.
METHOD: We present a novel DL-based method for the quantification of relative 
metabolite concentrations, using quantum-mechanics simulated metabolite 
responses and neural networks. We trained, validated, and evaluated the proposed 
networks with simulated and publicly accessible in-vivo human brain MRS data and 
compared the performance with traditional methods. A novel adaptive 
macromolecule fitting algorithm is included. We investigated the performance of 
the proposed methods in a Monte Carlo (MC) study.
RESULT: The validation using low-SNR simulated data demonstrated that the 
proposed methods could perform quantification comparably to other methods. The 
applicability of the proposed method for the quantification of in-vivo MRS data 
was demonstrated. Our proposed networks have the potential to reduce computation 
time significantly.
CONCLUSION: The proposed model-constrained deep neural networks trained in a 
self-supervised manner can offer fast and efficient quantification of MRS and 
MRSI data. Our proposed method has the potential to facilitate clinical practice 
by enabling faster processing of large datasets such as high-resolution MRSI 
datasets, which may have thousands of spectra.

Supervised and unsupervised DNNs were trained using simulation data. The accuracy and noise immunity of the three methods were compared using simulations and in vivo data. The simulation study investigated the differences between the predicted and ground‐truth values and their variations with the noise level. The in vivo study evaluated the predicted values from the original images and noise‐induced variations in the predicted values from the synthesized noisy images by adding Rician noise to the original images. The simulation study showed that CBF estimated using the supervised DNN was not biased by noise, whereas that estimated using other methods had a positive bias. Although the ATT with all methods exhibited a similar behavior with noise increase, the ATT with the supervised DNN was less biased. The in vivo study showed that CBF and ATT with the supervised DNN were the most accurate and that the supervised and unsupervised DNNs had the highest noise immunity in CBF and ATT estimations, respectively. Physics‐informed unsupervised learning can estimate CBF and ATT from multi‐delay ASL signals, and its performance is superior to that of the conventional method. Although noise immunity in ATT estimation was superior with unsupervised learning, other performances were superior with supervised learning.</jats:p>"

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is widely applied in tumor diagnosis by 
measuring the diffusion of water molecules. To increase the sensitivity to tumor 
identification, faithful high b-value DWI images are expected by setting a 
stronger strength of gradient field in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
However, high b-value DWI images are heavily affected by reduced signal-to-noise 
ratio due to the exponential decay of signal intensity. Thus, removing noise 
becomes important for high b-value DWI images. Here, we propose a 
Physics-Informed neural Network for high b-value DWI images Denoising (PIND) by 
leveraging information from physics-informed loss and prior information from low 
b-value DWI images with high signal-to-noise ratio. Experiments are conducted on 
a prostate DWI dataset that has 125 subjects. Compared with the original noisy 
images, PIND improves the peak signal-to-noise ratio from 31.25 dB to 36.28 dB, 
and structural similarity index measure from 0.77 to 0.92. Our schemes can save 
83% data acquisition time since fewer averages of high b-value DWI images need 
to be acquired, while maintaining 98% accuracy of the apparent diffusion 
coefficient value, suggesting its potential effectiveness in preserving 
essential diffusion characteristics. Reader study by 4 radiologists (3, 6, 13, 
and 18 years of experience) indicates PIND's promising performance on overall 
quality, signal-to-noise ratio, artifact suppression, and lesion conspicuity, 
showing potential for improving clinical DWI applications.

PURPOSE: To obtain better microstructural integrity, interstitial fluid, and 
microvascular images from multi-b-value diffusion MRI data by using a 
physics-informed neural network (PINN) fitting approach.
METHODS: Test-retest whole-brain inversion recovery diffusion-weighted images 
with multiple b-values (IVIM: intravoxel incoherent motion) were acquired on 
separate days for 16 patients with cerebrovascular disease on a 3.0T MRI system. 
The performance of the PINN three-component IVIM (3C-IVIM) model fitting 
approach was compared with conventional fitting approaches (i.e., non-negative 
least squares and two-step least squares) in terms of (1) parameter map quality, 
(2) test-retest repeatability, and (3) voxel-wise accuracy. Using the in vivo 
data, the parameter map quality was assessed by the parameter contrast-to-noise 
ratio (PCNR) between normal-appearing white matter and white matter 
hyperintensities, and test-retest repeatability was expressed by the coefficient 
of variation (CV) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The voxel-wise 
accuracy of the 3C-IVIM parameters was determined by 10,000 computer simulations 
mimicking our in vivo data. Differences in PCNR and CV values obtained with the 
PINN approach versus conventional fitting approaches were assessed using paired 
Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.
RESULTS: The PINN-derived 3C-IVIM parameter maps were of higher quality and more 
repeatable than those of conventional fitting approaches, while also achieving 
higher voxel-wise accuracy.
CONCLUSION: Physics-informed neural networks enable robust voxel-wise estimation 
of three diffusion components from the diffusion-weighted signal. The repeatable 
and high-quality biological parameter maps generated with PINNs allow for visual 
evaluation of pathophysiological processes in cerebrovascular disease.

BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides state-of-the-art image 
quality for neuroimaging, consisting of multiple separately acquired contrasts. 
Synthetic MRI aims to accelerate examinations by synthesizing any desirable 
contrast from a single acquisition.
PURPOSE: We developed a physics-informed deep learning-based method to 
synthesize multiple brain MRI contrasts from a single 5-min acquisition and 
investigate its ability to generalize to arbitrary contrasts.
METHODS: A dataset of 55 subjects acquired with a clinical MRI protocol and a 
5-min transient-state sequence was used. The model, based on a generative 
adversarial network, maps data acquired from the five-minute scan to ""effective"" 
quantitative parameter maps (q*-maps), feeding the generated PD, T1, and T2 maps 
into a signal model to synthesize four clinical contrasts (proton 
density-weighted, T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and T2-weighted fluid-attenuated 
inversion recovery), from which losses are computed. The synthetic contrasts are 
compared to an end-to-end deep learning-based method proposed by literature. The 
generalizability of the proposed method is investigated for five volunteers by 
synthesizing three contrasts unseen during training and comparing these to 
ground truth acquisitions via qualitative assessment and contrast-to-noise ratio 
(CNR) assessment.
RESULTS: The physics-informed method matched the quality of the end-to-end 
method for the four standard contrasts, with structural similarity metrics above 
0.75 ± 0.08 ( ± std), peak signal-to-noise ratios above 22.4 ± 1.9 , 
representing a portion of compact lesions comparable to standard MRI. 
Additionally, the physics-informed method enabled contrast adjustment, and 
similar signal contrast and comparable CNRs to the ground truth acquisitions for 
three sequences unseen during model training.
CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated the feasibility of physics-informed, deep 
learning-based synthetic MRI to generate high-quality contrasts and generalize 
to contrasts beyond the training data. This technology has the potential to 
accelerate neuroimaging protocols.

In recent years, a plethora of methods combining neural networks and partial 
differential equations have been developed. A widely known example are 
physics-informed neural networks, which solve problems involving partial 
differential equations by training a neural network. We apply physics-informed 
neural networks and the finite element method to estimate the diffusion 
coefficient governing the long term spread of molecules in the human brain from 
magnetic resonance images. Synthetic testcases are created to demonstrate that 
the standard formulation of the physics-informed neural network faces challenges 
with noisy measurements in our application. Our numerical results demonstrate 
that the residual of the partial differential equation after training needs to 
be small for accurate parameter recovery. To achieve this, we tune the weights 
and the norms used in the loss function and use residual based adaptive 
refinement of training points. We find that the diffusion coefficient estimated 
from magnetic resonance images with physics-informed neural networks becomes 
consistent with results from a finite element based approach when the residuum 
after training becomes small. The observations presented here are an important 
first step towards solving inverse problems on cohorts of patients in a 
semi-automated fashion with physics-informed neural networks.

Electroanatomical maps are a key tool in the diagnosis and treatment of atrial 
fibrillation. Current approaches focus on the activation times recorded. 
However, more information can be extracted from the available data. The fibers 
in cardiac tissue conduct the electrical wave faster, and their direction could 
be inferred from activation times. In this work, we employ a recently developed 
approach, called physics informed neural networks, to learn the fiber 
orientations from electroanatomical maps, taking into account the physics of the 
electrical wave propagation. In particular, we train the neural network to 
weakly satisfy the anisotropic eikonal equation and to predict the measured 
activation times. We use a local basis for the anisotropic conductivity tensor, 
which encodes the fiber orientation. The methodology is tested both in a 
synthetic example and for patient data. Our approach shows good agreement in 
both cases and it outperforms a state of the art method in the patient data. The 
results show a first step towards learning the fiber orientations from 
electroanatomical maps with physics-informed neural networks.

Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is widely used to 
assess tissue vascularization, particularly in oncological applications. 
However, the most widely used pharmacokinetic (PK) models do not account for 
contrast agent (CA) diffusion between neighboring voxels, which can limit the 
accuracy of the results, especially in cases of heterogeneous tumors. To address 
this issue, previous works have proposed algorithms that incorporate diffusion 
phenomena into the formulation. However, these algorithms often face convergence 
problems due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. In this work, we present a 
new approach to fitting DCE-MRI data that incorporates CA diffusion by using 
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). PINNs can be trained to fit measured 
data obtained from DCE-MRI while ensuring the mass conservation equation from 
the PK model. We compare the performance of PINNs to previous algorithms on 
different 1D cases inspired by previous works from literature. Results show that 
PINNs retrieve vascularization parameters more accurately from 
diffusion-corrected tracer-kinetic models. Furthermore, we demonstrate the 
robustness of PINNs compared to other traditional algorithms when faced with 
noisy or incomplete data. Overall, our results suggest that PINNs can be a 
valuable tool for improving the accuracy of DCE-MRI data analysis, particularly 
in cases where CA diffusion plays a significant role.

Predicting the infiltration of Glioblastoma (GBM) from medical MRI scans is 
crucial for understanding tumor growth dynamics and designing personalized 
radiotherapy treatment plans. Mathematical models of GBM growth can complement 
the data in the prediction of spatial distributions of tumor cells. However, 
this requires estimating patient-specific parameters of the model from clinical 
data, which is a challenging inverse problem due to limited temporal data and 
the limited time between imaging and diagnosis. This work proposes a method that 
uses Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to estimate patient-specific 
parameters of a reaction-diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) model of 
GBM growth from a single 3D structural MRI snapshot. PINNs embed both the data 
and the PDE into a loss function, thus integrating theory and data. Key 
innovations include the identification and estimation of characteristic 
non-dimensional parameters, a pre-training step that utilizes the 
non-dimensional parameters and a fine-tuning step to determine the patient 
specific parameters. Additionally, the diffuse-domain method is employed to 
handle the complex brain geometry within the PINN framework. The method is 
validated on both synthetic and patient datasets, showing promise for 
personalized GBM treatment through parametric inference within clinically 
relevant timeframes.

PURPOSE: To propose the simulation-based physics-informed neural network for 
deconvolution of dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI (SPINNED) as an 
alternative for more robust and accurate deconvolution compared to existing 
methods.
METHODS: The SPINNED method was developed by generating synthetic tissue residue 
functions and arterial input functions through mathematical simulations and by 
using them to create synthetic DSC MRI time series. The SPINNED model was 
trained using these simulated data to learn the underlying physical relation 
(deconvolution) between the DSC-MRI time series and the arterial input 
functions. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed SPINNED method were 
assessed by comparing it with two common deconvolution methods in DSC MRI data 
analysis, circulant singular value decomposition, and Volterra singular value 
decomposition, using both simulation data and real patient data.
RESULTS: The proposed SPINNED method was more accurate than the conventional 
methods across all SNR levels and showed better robustness against noise in both 
simulation and real patient data. The SPINNED method also showed much faster 
processing speed than the conventional methods.
CONCLUSION: These results support that the proposed SPINNED method can be a good 
alternative to the existing methods for resolving the deconvolution problem in 
DSC MRI. The proposed method does not require any separate ground-truth 
measurement for training and offers additional benefits of quick processing time 
and coverage of diverse clinical scenarios. Consequently, it will contribute to 
more reliable, accurate, and rapid diagnoses in clinical applications compared 
with the previous methods including those based on supervised learning.

SWENet: A Physics-Informed Deep Neural Network (PINN) for Shear Wave 
Elastography.

Yin Z, Li GY, Zhang Z, Zheng Y, Cao Y.

Shear wave elastography (SWE) enables the measurement of elastic properties of 
soft materials in a non-invasive manner and finds broad applications in various 
disciplines. The state-of-the-art SWE methods rely on the measurement of local 
shear wave speeds to infer material parameters and suffer from wave diffraction 
when applied to soft materials with strong heterogeneity. In the present study, 
we overcome this challenge by proposing a physics-informed neural network 
(PINN)-based SWE (SWENet) method. The spatial variation of elastic properties of 
inhomogeneous materials has been introduced in the governing equations, which 
are encoded in SWENet as loss functions. Snapshots of wave motions have been 
used to train neural networks, and during this course, the elastic properties 
within a region of interest illuminated by shear waves are inferred 
simultaneously. We performed finite element simulations, tissue-mimicking 
phantom experiments, and ex vivo experiments to validate the method. Our results 
show that the shear moduli of soft composites consisting of matrix and 
inclusions of several millimeters in cross-section dimensions with either 
regular or irregular geometries can be identified with excellent accuracy. The 
advantages of the SWENet over conventional SWE methods consist of using more 
features of the wave motions and enabling seamless integration of multi-source 
data in the inverse analysis. Given the advantages of SWENet, it may find broad 
applications where full wave fields get involved to infer heterogeneous 
mechanical properties, such as identifying small solid tumors with ultrasound 
SWE, and differentiating gray and white matters of the brain with magnetic 
resonance elastography.

We propose Physics-Informed Fourier Networks for Electrical Properties (EP) 
Tomography (PIFON-EPT), a novel deep learning-based method for EP reconstruction 
using noisy and/or incomplete magnetic resonance (MR) measurements. Our approach 
leverages the Helmholtz equation to constrain two networks, responsible for the 
denoising and completion of the transmit fields, and the estimation of the 
object's EP, respectively. We embed a random Fourier features mapping into our 
networks to enable efficient learning of high-frequency details encoded in the 
transmit fields. We demonstrated the efficacy of PIFON-EPT through several 
simulated experiments at 3 and 7 tesla(T) MR imaging, and showed that our method 
can reconstruct physically consistent EP and transmit fields. Specifically, when 
only 20% of the noisy measured fields were used as inputs, PIFON-EPT 
reconstructed the EP of a phantom with ≤ 5% error, and denoised and completed 
the measurements with ≤ 1% error. Additionally, we adapted PIFON-EPT to solve 
the generalized Helmholtz equation that accounts for gradients of EP between 
inhomogeneities. This yielded improved results at interfaces between different 
materials without explicit knowledge of boundary conditions. PIFON-EPT is the 
first method that can simultaneously reconstruct EP and transmit fields from 
incomplete noisy MR measurements, providing new opportunities for EPT research.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac MRI has become the gold-standard imaging technique for 
assessing cardiovascular morphology and function. In spite of this, its slow 
data acquisition process presents imaging challenges due to the motion from 
heartbeats, respiration, and blood flow. In recent studies, deep learning (DL) 
algorithms have shown promising results for the task of image reconstruction. 
However, there have been instances where they have introduced artifacts that may 
be misinterpreted as pathologies or may obscure the detection of pathologies. 
Therefore, it is important to obtain a metric, such as the uncertainty of the 
network output, that identifies such artifacts. However, this can be quite 
challenging for large-scale image reconstruction problems such as dynamic 
multi-coil non-Cartesian MRI.
PURPOSE: To efficiently quantify uncertainties of a physics-informed DL-based 
image reconstruction method for a large-scale accelerated 2D multi-coil dynamic 
radial MRI reconstruction problem, and demonstrate the benefits of 
physics-informed DL over model-agnostic DL in reducing uncertainties while at 
the same time improving image quality.
METHODS: We extended a recently proposed physics-informed 2D U-Net that learns 
spatio-temporal slices (named XT-YT U-Net), and employed it for the task of 
uncertainty quantification (UQ) by using Monte Carlo dropout and a Gaussian 
negative log-likelihood loss function. Our data comprised 2D dynamic MR images 
acquired with a radial balanced steady-state free precession sequence. The XT-YT 
U-Net, which allows for training with a limited amount of data, was trained and 
validated on a dataset of 15 healthy volunteers, and further tested on data from 
four patients. An extensive comparison between physics-informed and 
model-agnostic neural networks (NNs) concerning the obtained image quality and 
uncertainty estimates was performed. Further, we employed calibration plots to 
assess the quality of the UQ.
RESULTS: The inclusion of the MR-physics model of data acquisition as a building 
block in the NN architecture led to higher image quality (NRMSE: - 33 ± 8.2% , 
PSNR: 6.3 ± 1.3% , and SSIM: 1.9 ± 0.96% ), lower uncertainties ( - 46 ± 8.7% ), 
and, based on the calibration plots, an improved UQ compared to its 
model-agnostic counterpart. Furthermore, the UQ information can be used to 
differentiate between anatomical structures (e.g., coronary arteries, ventricle 
boundaries) and artifacts.
CONCLUSIONS: Using an XT-YT U-Net, we were able to quantify uncertainties of a 
physics-informed NN for a high-dimensional and computationally demanding 2D 
multi-coil dynamic MR imaging problem. In addition to improving the image 
quality, embedding the acquisition model in the network architecture decreased 
the reconstruction uncertainties as well as quantitatively improved the UQ. The 
UQ provides additional information to assess the performance of different 
network approaches.

In this work an innovative approach was developed to address a significant 
challenge in the field of radiation dosimetry: the accurate measurement of 
spatial dose distributions using Fricke gel dosimeters. Hydrogels are widely 
used in radiation dosimetry due to their ability to simulate the 
tissue-equivalent properties of human tissue, making them ideal for measuring 
and mapping radiation dose distributions. Among the various gel dosimeters, 
Fricke gels exploit the radiation-induced oxidation of ferrous ions to ferric 
ions and are particularly notable due to their sensitivity. The concentration of 
ferric ions can be measured using various techniques, including magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) or spectrophotometry. While Fricke gels offer several 
advantages, a significant hurdle to their widespread application is the 
diffusion of ferric ions within the gel matrix. This phenomenon leads to a 
blurring of the dose distribution over time, compromising the accuracy of dose 
measurements. To mitigate the issue of ferric ion diffusion, researchers have 
explored various strategies such as the incorporation of additives or 
modification of the gel composition to either reduce the mobility of ferric ions 
or stabilize the gel matrix. The computational method proposed leverages the 
power of artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, to mitigate the 
effects of ferric ion diffusion that can compromise measurement precision. By 
employing Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), the method introduces a 
novel way to apply physical laws directly within the learning process, 
optimizing the network to adhere to the principles governing ion diffusion. This 
is particularly advantageous for solving the partial differential equations that 
describe the diffusion process in 2D and 3D. By inputting the spatial 
distribution of ferric ions at a given time, along with boundary conditions and 
the diffusion coefficient, the model can backtrack to accurately reconstruct the 
original ion distribution. This capability is crucial for enhancing the fidelity 
of 3D spatial dose measurements, ensuring that the data reflect the true dose 
distribution without the artifacts introduced by ion migration. Here, 
multidimensional models able to handle 2D and 3D data were developed and tested 
against dose distributions numerically evolved in time from 20 to 100 h. The 
results in terms of various metrics show a significant agreement in both 2D and 
3D dose distributions. In particular, the mean square error of the prediction 
spans the range 1×10-6-1×10-4, while the gamma analysis results in a 90-100% 
passing rate with 3%/2 mm, depending on the elapsed time, the type of 
distribution modeled and the dimensionality. This method could expand the 
applicability of Fricke gel dosimeters to a wider range of measurement tasks, 
from simple planar dose assessments to intricate volumetric analyses. The 
proposed technique holds great promise for overcoming the limitations imposed by 
ion diffusion in Fricke gel dosimeters.

Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging is an important tool for mapping tissue 
microstructure and structural connectivity non-invasively in the in vivo human 
brain. Numerous diffusion signal models are proposed to quantify microstructural 
properties. Nonetheless, accurate estimation of model parameters is 
computationally expensive and impeded by image noise. Supervised deep 
learning-based estimation approaches exhibit efficiency and superior performance 
but require additional training data and may be not generalizable. A new 
DIffusion Model OptimizatioN framework using physics-informed and 
self-supervised Deep learning entitled ""DIMOND"" is proposed to address this 
problem. DIMOND employs a neural network to map input image data to model 
parameters and optimizes the network by minimizing the difference between the 
input acquired data and synthetic data generated via the diffusion model 
parametrized by network outputs. DIMOND produces accurate diffusion tensor 
imaging results and is generalizable across subjects and datasets. Moreover, 
DIMOND outperforms conventional methods for fitting sophisticated 
microstructural models including the kurtosis and NODDI model. Importantly, 
DIMOND reduces NODDI model fitting time from hours to minutes, or seconds by 
leveraging transfer learning. In summary, the self-supervised manner, high 
efficacy, and efficiency of DIMOND increase the practical feasibility and 
adoption of microstructure and connectivity mapping in clinical and 
neuroscientific applications.

Background: Pulmonary arterial pressure is a key parameter for diagnosing 
cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. Its measurement through right heart 
catheterization is considered the gold standard, and it is an invasive procedure 
that entails significant risks for patients. This has motivated the development 
of non-invasive techniques based on patient-specific imaging, such as 
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which integrate clinical measurements 
with physical models, such as the 1D reduced Navier-Stokes model, enabling 
biologically plausible predictions with limited data. Methods: This work 
implements a PINN model that uses velocity and area measurements in the main 
bifurcation of the pulmonary artery, comprising the main artery and its 
secondary branches, to predict pressure, velocity, and area variations 
throughout the bifurcation. The model training includes penalties to satisfy the 
laws of flow and momentum conservation. Results: The results show that, using 4D 
Flow MRI images from a healthy patient as clinical data, the pressure estimates 
provided by the model are consistent with the expected ranges reported in the 
literature, reaching a mean arterial pressure of 21.5 mmHg. Conclusions: This 
model presents an innovative approach that avoids invasive methods, being the 
first study to apply PINNs to estimate pulmonary arterial pressure in 
bifurcations. In future work, we aim to validate the model in larger populations 
and confirm pulmonary hypertension cases diagnosed through catheterization.

BACKGROUND: Perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)s plays a central role in 
the diagnosis and monitoring of neurovascular or neurooncological disease. 
However, conventional processing techniques are limited in their ability to 
capture relevant characteristics of the perfusion dynamics and suffer from a 
lack of standardization.
PURPOSE: We propose a physics-informed deep learning framework which is capable 
of analyzing dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion MRI data and recovering 
the dynamic tissue response with high accuracy.
METHODS: The framework uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to learn 
the voxel-wise TRF, which represents the dynamic response of the local vascular 
network to the contrast agent bolus. The network output is stabilized by total 
variation and elastic net regularization. Parameter maps of normalized cerebral 
blood flow (nCBF) and volume (nCBV) are then calculated from the predicted 
residue functions. The results are validated using extensive comparisons to 
values derived by conventional Tikhonov-regularized singular value decomposition 
(TiSVD), in silico simulations and an in vivo dataset of perfusion MRI exams of 
patients with high-grade gliomas.
RESULTS: The simulation results demonstrate that PINN-derived residue functions 
show a high concordance with the true functions and that the calculated values 
of nCBF and nCBV converge towards the true values for higher contrast-to-noise 
ratios. In the in vivo dataset, we find high correlations between conventionally 
derived and PINN-predicted perfusion parameters (Pearson's rho for nCBF: 
0.84 ± 0.03 and nCBV: 0.92 ± 0.03 ) and very high indices of image similarity 
(structural similarity index for nCBF: 0.91 ± 0.03 and for nCBV: 0.98 ± 0.00 ).
CONCLUSIONS: PINNs can be used to analyze perfusion MRI data and stably recover 
the response functions of the local vasculature with high accuracy.

PURPOSE: Deep learning superresolution (SR) is a promising approach to reduce 
MRI scan time without requiring custom sequences or iterative reconstruction. 
Previous deep learning SR approaches have generated low-resolution training 
images by simple k-space truncation, but this does not properly model in-plane 
turbo spin echo (TSE) MRI resolution degradation, which has variable T2 
relaxation effects in different k-space regions. To fill this gap, we developed 
a T2 -deblurred deep learning SR method for the SR of 3D-TSE images.
METHODS: A SR generative adversarial network was trained using physically 
realistic resolution degradation (asymmetric T2 weighting of raw high-resolution 
k-space data). For comparison, we trained the same network structure on previous 
degradation models without TSE physics modeling. We tested all models for both 
retrospective and prospective SR with 3 × 3 acceleration factor (in the two 
phase-encoding directions) of genetically engineered mouse embryo model TSE-MR 
images.
RESULTS: The proposed method can produce high-quality 3 × 3 SR images for a 
typical 500-slice volume with 6-7 mouse embryos. Because 3 × 3 SR was performed, 
the image acquisition time can be reduced from 15 h to 1.7 h. Compared to 
previous SR methods without TSE modeling, the proposed method achieved the best 
quantitative imaging metrics for both retrospective and prospective evaluations 
and achieved the best imaging-quality expert scores for prospective evaluation.
CONCLUSION: The proposed T2 -deblurring method improved accuracy and image 
quality of deep learning-based SR of TSE MRI. This method has the potential to 
accelerate TSE image acquisition by a factor of up to 9.

Joint [Formula: see text] and Image Reconstruction in Low-Field MRI by 
Physics-Informed Deep-Learning.

Schote D, Winter L, Kolbitsch C, Rose G, Speck O, Kofler A.

OBJECTIVE: We present a model-based image reconstruction approach based on 
unrolled neural networks which corrects for image distortion and noise in 
low-field ( B0  ∼  50 mT) MRI.
METHODS: Utilising knowledge about the underlying physics, a novel network 
architecture (SH-Net) is introduced which involves the estimation of spherical 
harmonic coefficients to guarantee a spatially smooth field map estimate. The 
SH-Net is integrated in an end-to-end trainable model which jointly estimates 
the B0-field map as well as the image. Experiments were conducted on 
retrospectively simulated low-field data of human knees.
RESULTS: We compare our model to different model-based approaches at distinct 
noise levels and various B0-field distributions. Our results show that our 
physics-informed neural network approach outperforms the purely model-based 
methods by improving the PSNR up to 11.7% and the RMSE up to 86.3%.
CONCLUSION: Our end-to-end trained model-based approach outperforms existing 
methods in reconstructing image and B0-field maps in the low-field regime.
SIGNIFICANCE: low-field MRI is becoming increasingly more popular as it enables 
access to MR in challenging situations such as intensive care units or resource 
poor areas. Our method allows for fast and accurate image reconstruction in such 
low-field imaging with B0-inhomogeneity compensation under a wide range of 
various environmental conditions.

Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is an MRI 
technique for quantifying perfusion that can be used in clinical applications 
for classification of tumours and other types of diseases. Conventionally, the 
non-linear least squares (NLLS) methods is used for tracer-kinetic modelling of 
DCE data. However, despite promising results, NLLS suffers from long processing 
times (minutes-hours) and noisy parameter maps due to the non-convexity of the 
cost function. In this work, we investigated physics-informed deep neural 
networks for estimating physiological parameters from DCE-MRI signal-curves. 
Three voxel-wise temporal frameworks (FCN, LSTM, GRU) and two spatio-temporal 
frameworks (CNN, U-Net) were investigated. The accuracy and precision of 
parameter estimation by the temporal frameworks were evaluated in simulations. 
All networks showed higher precision than the NLLS. Specifically, the GRU showed 
to decrease the random error on ve by a factor of 4.8 with respect to the NLLS 
for noise (SD) of 1/20. The accuracy was better for the prediction of the ve 
parameter in all networks compared to the NLLS. The GRU and LSTM worked with 
arbitrary acquisition lengths. The GRU was selected for in vivo evaluation and 
compared to the spatio-temporal frameworks in 28 patients with pancreatic 
cancer. All neural network approaches showed less noisy parameter maps than the 
NLLS. The GRU had better test-retest repeatability than the NLLS for all three 
parameters and was able to detect one additional patient with significant 
changes in DCE parameters post chemo-radiotherapy. Although the U-Net and CNN 
had even better test-retest characteristics than the GRU, and were able to 
detect even more responders, they also showed potential systematic errors in the 
parameter maps. Therefore, we advise using our GRU framework for analysing DCE 
data.

This work introduces a novel integration of Physics-Informed Neural Networks 
(PINNs) with hyperelastic material modeling, employing the Neo-Hookean model to 
estimate the stiffness of soft tissue organs based on realistic anatomical 
geometries. Specifically, we propose the modeling of the prostate biomechanics 
as an initial application of this framework. By combining machine learning with 
principles of continuum mechanics, the methodology leverages finite element 
method (FEM) simulations and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived prostate 
models to address forward and inverse biomechanical problems. The PINN framework 
demonstrates the ability to provide accurate material property estimations, 
requiring limited data while overcoming challenges in data scarcity. This 
approach marks a significant advancement in patient-specific precision medicine, 
enabling improved diagnostics, personalized treatment planning, and broader 
applications in the biomechanical characterization of other soft tissues and 
organ systems.

Arterial spin labelling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables cerebral 
perfusion measurement, which is crucial in detecting and managing neurological 
issues in infants born prematurely or after perinatal complications. However, 
cerebral blood flow (CBF) estimation in infants using ASL remains challenging 
due to the complex interplay of network physiology, involving dynamic 
interactions between cardiac output and cerebral perfusion, as well as issues 
with parameter uncertainty and data noise. We propose a new spatial 
uncertainty-based physics-informed neural network (PINN), SUPINN, to estimate 
CBF and other parameters from infant ASL data. SUPINN employs a multi-branch 
architecture to concurrently estimate regional and global model parameters 
across multiple voxels. It computes regional spatial uncertainties to weigh the 
signal. SUPINN can reliably estimate CBF (relative error - 0.3 ± 71.7 ), bolus 
arrival time (AT) (30.5 ± 257.8) , and blood longitudinal relaxation time (T1b) 
(-4.4 ± 28.9), surpassing parameter estimates performed using least squares or 
standard PINNs. Furthermore, SUPINN produces physiologically plausible spatially 
smooth CBF and AT maps. Our study demonstrates the successful modification of 
PINNs for accurate multi-parameter perfusion estimation from noisy and limited 
ASL data in infants. Frameworks like SUPINN have the potential to advance our 
understanding of the complex cardio-brain network physiology, aiding in the 
detection and management of diseases. Source code is provided at:

Background Four-dimensional (4D) flow MRI provides assessment of thoracic aorta 
hemodynamic measures that are increasingly recognized as important biomarkers 
for risk assessment. However, long acquisition times and cumbersome data 
analysis limit widespread availability. Purpose To evaluate the feasibility and 
accuracy of a generative artificial intelligence (AI) approach (fluid 
physics-informed cycle generative adversarial network [FPI-CycleGAN]) in 
quantifying aorta hemodynamics directly from anatomic input as an alternative to 
4D flow MRI. Materials and Methods Patients were retrospectively identified from 
a dataset of clinical cardiothoracic MRI examinations performed between November 
2011 and July 2020. All patients underwent aortic 4D flow MRI, which served as a 
reference standard for training and testing of FPI-CycleGANs. A 
three-dimensional (3D) segmentation of the aortic geometry was used as the only 
input to predict systolic aortic hemodynamics, with separate networks for 
bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) (994 in the training set and 248 in the test set) 
and tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) (419 in the training set and 104 in the test 
set). Voxel-by-voxel and regional analyses were used to quantify and compare (AI 
vs the reference standard, 4D flow) systolic velocity vector fields, peak 
velocity, wall shear stress (WSS), and classification of aortic valve stenosis. 
Results In total, 1765 patients (median age, 53 years [IQR, 41-63 years]; 1242 
patients had BAV and 523 had TAV) were included. Mean AI computation time was 
0.15 second ± 0.11 (SD), and total training was 1500 and 3600 minutes for the 
TAV and BAV networks, respectively. The FPI-CycleGAN predicted systolic 3D 
velocity vector fields accurately, with low bias (<0.01 m/sec) and excellent 
limits of agreements (±0.06-0.08 m/sec). For peak velocities and WSS, there was 
strong agreement between FPI-CycleGAN and 4D flow (r2 = 0.930-0.957 [P < .001], 
with relative differences of 6.2%-9.8%). AI accurately classified aortic valve 
stenosis severity in 85.8% of patients (302 of 352) (κ = 0.80 [95% CI: 0.71, 
0.89]). The FPI-CycleGAN was robust to one- and two-voxel dilation and erosion 
(bias, -0.05 to 0.1 m/sec) and ±5° rotation (bias, -0.02 to 0.03 m/sec) of the 
input data. The application of the trained FPI-CycleGAN in an external test set 
with contrast-enhanced MR angiography (n = 60 patients) as AI input data 
demonstrated strong to excellent performance for peak velocities and WSS (r2 = 
0.944-0.965 [P < .001], with relative differences of 6.2%-9.2%). Conclusion 
Aorta 3D hemodynamics can be derived from anatomic input in less than 1 second 
using an FPI-CycleGAN and demonstrate strong agreement with in vivo 4D flow MRI 
systolic hemodynamics. © RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this

BACKGROUND: Unrolled neural networks (NNs) have been extensively applied to 
different image reconstruction problems across all imaging modalities. A key 
component of the latter is that they allow for physics-informed learning of the 
regularization method, which is parametrized by the NN. However, due to the lack 
of understanding of deep NNs from a theoretical point of view, unrolled NNs are 
still black-boxes when the regularizers are given by deep NNs, for example, 
U-Nets.
PURPOSE: Dictionarylearning (DL) is a well-established regularization method, 
which is based on learning a transform to sparsely approximate the signals of 
interest. Typically, DL-based image reconstruction either employs a dictionary, 
which was pretrained on a set of patches which were extracted from ground-truth 
images or a dictionary which is jointly trained during the reconstruction. 
However, in both cases, the used DL-algorithms are not designed to take into 
account the reconstruction problem or the underlying physical model, which 
describes the imaging process. In this work, we propose a DL-algorithm based on 
unrolled NNs to overcome these limitations.
METHODS: We construct an unrolled NN, which corresponds to an unrolled DL-based 
reconstruction algorithm and train the unrolled NN to optimize its weights, that 
is, the atoms of the dictionary, by back-propagation in a supervised manner. 
Further, we propose a new way to employ a 2D dictionary in the spatio-temporal 
domain. We tested and evaluated the method on an accelerated cardiac cine MR 
image reconstruction problem using 216/36/36 dynamic images for training, 
validation, and testing and compared it to two well-known state-of-the-art 
approaches for cardiac cine MRI based on deep iterative CNNs. Further, we 
analyze the obtained dictionaries in terms of dictionary-coherence and structure 
of the atoms. Last, we compare the reported methods in terms of stability by 
applying them to an entirely different dataset consisting of 49 different 
test images.
RESULTS: The investigated physics-informed DL-approach yields significantly more 
accurate reconstructions compared to the DL-method, which uses dictionaries 
obtained by decoupled pretraining, thereby providing an improvement of up to 
4.90 dB in terms of PSNR and 5% in terms of SSIM. Further, the proposed 
spatio-temporal 2D dictionary outperforms the 1D and 3D dictionaries by 
preventing smoothing of image details while still accurately removing 
undersampling artifacts and noise resulting in an increase of up to 1.10 dB in 
terms of PSNR and 4% in terms of SSIM. Although being surpassed by the CNNs on 
the first dataset, the proposed NNs-based DL method is more stable compared to 
the latter approach and yields comparable results on the second dataset. Last, 
it has the advantage of being entirely interpretable in each component.
CONCLUSIONS: The presented physics-informed NN can be used as training algorithm 
for a classical and interpretable data-driven regularization method based on a 
learned dictionary, which can then not only be linked to the considered data but 
also to the reconstruction method that the NN defines.

The brain extracellular space (ECS), an irregular, extremely tortuous nanoscale 
space located between cells or between cells and blood vessels, is crucial for 
nerve cell survival. It plays a pivotal role in high-level brain functions such 
as memory, emotion, and sensation. However, the specific form of molecular 
transport within the ECS remain elusive. To address this challenge, this paper 
proposes a novel approach to quantitatively analyze the molecular transport 
within the ECS by solving an inverse problem derived from the 
advection-diffusion equation (ADE) using a physics-informed neural network 
(PINN). PINN provides a streamlined solution to the ADE without the need for 
intricate mathematical formulations or grid settings. Additionally, the 
optimization of PINN facilitates the automatic computation of the diffusion 
coefficient governing long-term molecule transport and the velocity of molecules 
driven by advection. Consequently, the proposed method allows for the 
quantitative analysis and identification of the specific pattern of molecular 
transport within the ECS through the calculation of the Péclet number. 
Experimental validation on two datasets of magnetic resonance images (MRIs) 
captured at different time points showcases the effectiveness of the proposed 
method. Notably, our simulations reveal identical molecular transport patterns 
between datasets representing rats with tracer injected into the same brain 
region. These findings highlight the potential of PINN as a promising tool for 
comprehensively exploring molecular transport within the ECS.

The development of cerebrovascular disease is tightly coupled to regional 
changes in intracranial flow and relative pressure. Image-based assessment using 
phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging has particular promise for 
non-invasive full-field mapping of cerebrovascular hemodynamics. However, 
estimations are complicated by the narrow and tortuous intracranial vasculature, 
with accurate image-based quantification directly dependent on sufficient 
spatial resolution. Further, extended scan times are required for 
high-resolution acquisitions, and most clinical acquisitions are performed at 
comparably low resolution (>1 mm) where biases have been observed with regard to 
the quantification of both flow and relative pressure. The aim of our study was 
to develop an approach for quantitative intracranial super-resolution 4D Flow 
MRI, with effective resolution enhancement achieved by a dedicated deep residual 
network, and with accurate quantification of functional relative pressures 
achieved by subsequent physics-informed image processing. To achieve this, our 
two-step approach was trained and validated in a patient-specific in-silico 
cohort, showing good accuracy in estimating velocity (relative error: 
15.0 ± 0.1%, mean absolute error (MAE): 0.07 ± 0.06 m/s, and cosine similarity: 
0.99 ± 0.06 at peak velocity) and flow (relative error: 6.6 ± 4.7%, root mean 
square error (RMSE): 0.56 mL/s at peak flow), and with the coupled 
physics-informed image analysis allowing for maintained recovery of functional 
relative pressure throughout the circle of Willis (relative error: 11.0 ± 7.3%, 
RMSE: 0.3 ± 0.2 mmHg). Furthermore, the quantitative super-resolution approach 
is applied to an in-vivo volunteer cohort, effectively generating intracranial 
flow images at <0.5 mm resolution and showing reduced low-resolution bias in 
relative pressure estimation. Our work thus presents a promising two-step 
approach to non-invasively quantify cerebrovascular hemodynamics, being 
applicable to dedicated clinical cohorts in the future.

OBJECTIVE: Deep complex convolutional networks (DCCNs) utilize complex-valued 
convolutions and can process complex-valued MRI signals directly without 
splitting them into two real-valued magnitude and phase components. The 
performance of DCCN and real-valued U-Net is thoroughly investigated in the 
physics-informed subject-specific ad-hoc reconstruction method for fat-water 
separation and is compared against a widely used reference approach.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive test dataset (n = 33) was used for 
performance analysis. The 2012 ISMRM fat-water separation workshop dataset 
containing 28 batches of multi-echo MRIs with 3-15 echoes from the abdomen, 
thigh, knee, and phantoms, acquired with 1.5 T and 3 T scanners were used. 
Additionally, five MAFLD patients multi-echo MRIs acquired from our clinical 
radiology department were also used.
RESULTS: The quantitative results demonstrated that DCCN produced fat-water maps 
with better normalized RMS error and structural similarity index with the 
reference approach, compared to real-valued U-Nets in the ad-hoc reconstruction 
method for fat-water separation. The DCCN achieved an overall average SSIM of 
0.847 ± 0.069 and 0.861 ± 0.078 in generating fat and water maps, respectively, 
in contrast the U-Net achieved only 0.653 ± 0.166 and 0.729 ± 0.134. The average 
liver PDFF from DCCN achieved a correlation coefficient R of 0.847 with the 
reference approach.

Magnetic Resonance (MR) parameters mapping in muscle Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
(mMRI) is predominantly performed using pattern recognition-based algorithms, 
which are characterised by high computational costs and scalability issues in 
the context of multi-parametric mapping. Deep Learning (DL) has been 
demonstrated to be a robust and efficient method for rapid MR parameters 
mapping. However, its application in mMRI domain to investigate Neuromuscular 
Disorders (NMDs) has not yet been explored. In addition, data-driven DL models 
suffered in interpretation and explainability of the learning process. We 
developed a Physics Informed Neural Network called Myo-Regressor Deep Informed 
Neural NetwOrk (Myo-DINO) for efficient and explainable Fat Fraction (FF), 
water-T2 (wT2) and B1 mapping from a cohort of NMDs.A total of 2165 slices (232 
subjects) from Multi-Echo Spin Echo (MESE) images were selected as the input 
dataset for which FF, wT2,B1 ground truth maps were computed using the MyoQMRI 
toolbox. This toolbox exploits the Extended Phase Graph (EPG) theory with a 
two-component model (water and fat signal) and slice profile to simulate the 
signal evolution in the MESE framework. A customized U-Net architecture was 
implemented as the Myo-DINO architecture. The squared L2 norm loss was 
complemented by two distinct physics models to define two 'Physics-Informed' 
loss functions: Cycling Loss 1 embedded a mono-exponential model to describe the 
relaxation of water protons, while Cycling Loss 2 incorporated the EPG theory 
with slice profile to model the magnetization dephasing under the effect of 
gradients and RF pulses. The Myo-DINO was trained with the hyperparameter value 
of the 'Physics-Informed' component held constant, i.e. λmodel = 1, while 
different hyperparameter values (λcnn) were applied to the squared L2 norm 
component in both the cycling loss. In particular, hard (λcnn=10), normal 
(λcnn=1) and self-supervised (λcnn=0) constraints were applied to gradually 
decrease the impact of the squared L2 norm component on the 'Physics Informed' 
term during the Myo-DINO training process. Myo-DINO achieved higher performance 
with Cycling Loss 2 for FF, wT2 and B1 prediction. In particular, high 
reconstruction similarity and quality (Structural Similarity Index > 0.92, Peak 
Signal to Noise ratio > 30.0 db) and small reconstruction error (Normalized Root 
Mean Squared Error < 0.038) to the reference maps were shown with 
self-supervised weighting of the Cycling Loss 2. In addition muscle-wise FF, wT2 
and B1 predicted values showed good agreement with the reference values. The 
Myo-DINO has been demonstrated to be a robust and efficient workflow for MR 
parameters mapping in the context of mMRI. This provides preliminary evidence 
that it can be an effective alternative to the reference post-processing 
algorithm. In addition, our results demonstrate that Cycling Loss 2, which 
incorporates the Extended Phase Graph (EPG) model, provides the most robust and 
relevant physical constraints for Myo-DINO in this multi-parameter regression 
task. The use of Cycling Loss 2 with self-supervised constraint improved the 
explainability of the learning process because the network acquired domain 
knowledge solely in accordance with the assumptions of the EPG model.

BACKGROUND: Perfusion MRI is a well-established imaging modality with a 
multitude of applications in oncological and cardiovascular imaging. Clinically 
used processing methods, while stable and robust, have remained largely 
unchanged in recent years. Despite promising results from novel methods, their 
relatively minimal improvement compared to established methods did not generally 
warrant significant changes to clinical perfusion processing.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Machine learning in general and deep learning in 
particular, which are currently revolutionizing computer-aided diagnosis, may 
carry the potential to change this situation and truly capture the potential of 
perfusion imaging. Recent advances in the training of recurrent neural networks 
make it possible to predict and classify time series data with high accuracy. 
Combining physics-based tissue models and deep learning, using either 
physics-informed neural networks or universal differential equations, simplifies 
the training process and increases the interpretability of the resulting models. 
Due to their versatility, these methods will potentially be useful in bridging 
the gap between microvascular architecture and perfusion parameters, akin to MR 
fingerprinting in structural MR imaging. Still, further research is urgently 
needed before these methods may be used in clinical practice.
KEY POINTS: · Machine learning offers promising methods for processing of 
perfusion data.. · Recurrent neural networks can classify time series with high 
accuracy.. · Data augmentation is essentially especially when using small 
datasets..

PURPOSE: Earlier work showed that IVIM-NETorig , an unsupervised 
physics-informed deep neural network, was faster and more accurate than other 
state-of-the-art intravoxel-incoherent motion (IVIM) fitting approaches to 
diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). This study presents a substantially improved 
version, IVIM-NEToptim , and characterizes its superior performance in 
pancreatic cancer patients.
METHOD: In simulations (signal-to-noise ratio [SNR] = 20), the accuracy, 
independence, and consistency of IVIM-NET were evaluated for combinations of 
hyperparameters (fit S0, constraints, network architecture, number of hidden 
layers, dropout, batch normalization, learning rate), by calculating the 
normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE), Spearman's ρ, and the coefficient of 
variation (CVNET ), respectively. The best performing network, IVIM-NEToptim was 
compared to least squares (LS) and a Bayesian approach at different SNRs. 
IVIM-NEToptim 's performance was evaluated in an independent dataset of 23 
patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Fourteen of the patients 
received no treatment between two repeated scan sessions and nine received 
chemoradiotherapy between the repeated sessions. Intersession within-subject 
standard deviations (wSD) and treatment-induced changes were assessed.
RESULTS: In simulations (SNR = 20), IVIM-NEToptim outperformed IVIM-NETorig in 
accuracy (NRMSE(D) = 0.177 vs 0.196; NMRSE(f) = 0.220 vs 0.267; NMRSE(D*) = 
0.386 vs 0.393), independence (ρ(D*, f) = 0.22 vs 0.74), and consistency (CVNET 
(D) = 0.013 vs 0.104; CVNET (f) = 0.020 vs 0.054; CVNET (D*) = 0.036 vs 0.110). 
IVIM-NEToptim showed superior performance to the LS and Bayesian approaches at 
SNRs < 50. In vivo, IVIM-NEToptim showed significantly less noisy parameter maps 
with lower wSD for D and f than the alternatives. In the treated cohort, 
IVIM-NEToptim detected the most individual patients with significant parameter 
changes compared to day-to-day variations.
CONCLUSION: IVIM-NEToptim is recommended for accurate, informative, and 
consistent IVIM fitting to DWI data.

PURPOSE: Multiparametric arterial spin labeling (MP-ASL) can quantify cerebral 
blood flow (CBF) and arterial cerebral blood volume (CBVa). However, its 
accuracy is compromised owing to its intrinsically low SNR, necessitating 
complex and time-consuming parameter estimation. Deep neural networks (DNNs) 
offer a solution to these limitations. Therefore, we aimed to develop 
simulation-based DNNs for MP-ASL and compared the performance of a supervised 
DNN (DNNSup), physics-informed unsupervised DNN (DNNUns), and the conventional 
lookup table method (LUT) using simulation and in vivo data.
METHODS: MP-ASL was performed twice during resting state and once during the 
breath-holding task. First, the accuracy and noise immunity were evaluated in 
the first resting state. Second, CBF and CBVa values were statistically compared 
between the first resting state and the breath-holding task using the Wilcoxon 
signed-rank test and Cliff's delta. Finally, reproducibility of the two resting 
states was assessed.
RESULTS: Simulation and first resting-state analyses demonstrated that DNNSup 
had higher accuracy, noise immunity, and a six-fold faster computation time than 
LUT. Furthermore, all methods detected task-induced CBF and CBVa elevations, 
with the effect size being larger with the DNNSup (CBF, p = 0.055, Δ = 0.286; 
CBVa, p = 0.008, Δ = 0.964) and DNNUns (CBF, p = 0.039, Δ = 0.286; CBVa, 
p = 0.008, Δ = 1.000) than that with LUT (CBF, p = 0.109, Δ = 0.214; CBVa, 
p = 0.008, Δ = 0.929). Moreover, all the methods exhibited comparable and 
satisfactory reproducibility.
CONCLUSION: DNNSup outperforms DNNUns and LUT with respect to estimation 
performance and computation time.

Physics-Informed DeepMRI: k-Space Interpolation Meets Heat Diffusion.

Y, Zhang J, Liu Q, Liang D.

Recently, diffusion models have shown considerable promise for MRI 
reconstruction. However, extensive experimentation has revealed that these 
models are prone to generating artifacts due to the inherent randomness involved 
in generating images from pure noise. To achieve more controlled image 
reconstruction, we reexamine the concept of interpolatable physical priors in 
k-space data, focusing specifically on the interpolation of high-frequency (HF) 
k-space data from low-frequency (LF) k-space data. Broadly, this insight drives 
a shift in the generation paradigm from random noise to a more deterministic 
approach grounded in the existing LF k-space data. Building on this, we first 
establish a relationship between the interpolation of HF k-space data from LF 
k-space data and the reverse heat diffusion process, providing a fundamental 
framework for designing diffusion models that generate missing HF data. To 
further improve reconstruction accuracy, we integrate a traditional 
physics-informed k-space interpolation model into our diffusion framework as a 
data fidelity term. Experimental validation using publicly available datasets 
demonstrates that our approach significantly surpasses traditional k-space 
interpolation methods, deep learning-based k-space interpolation techniques, and 
conventional diffusion models, particularly in HF regions. Finally, we assess 
the generalization performance of our model across various out-of-distribution 
datasets. Our code are available at https://github.com/ZhuoxuCui/Heat-Diffusion.

The disease amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic dysfunction, and 
neuronal death gradually accumulate throughout Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
resulting in cognitive decline and functional disability. The challenges of 
dataset quality, interpretability, ethical integration, population variety, and 
picture standardization must be addressed using deep learning for the functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) classification of AD in order to guarantee a 
trustworthy and practical therapeutic application. In this manuscript 
Classifying AD using a finite basis physics neural network (CAD-FBPINN) is 
proposed. Initially, images are collected from AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
dataset. The images are fed to Pre-processing segment. During the preprocessing 
phase the reverse lognormal Kalman filter (RLKF) is used to enhance the input 
images. Then the preprocessed images are given to the feature extraction 
process. Feature extraction is done by Newton-time-extracting wavelet transform 
(NTEWT), which is used to extract the statistical features such as the mean, 
kurtosis, and skewness. Finally the features extracted are given to FBPINNs for 
Classifying AD such as early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), AD, mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), normal 
control (NC), and subjective memory complaints (SMCs). In General, FBPINN does 
not express adapting optimization strategies to determine optimal factors to 
ensure correct AD classification. Hence, sea-horse optimization algorithm (SHOA) 
to optimize FBPINN, which accurately classifies AD. The proposed technique 
implemented in python and efficacy of the CAD-FBPINN technique is assessed with 
support of numerous performances like accuracy, precision, Recall, F1-score, 
specificity and negative predictive value (NPV) is analyzed. Proposed CAD-FBPINN 
method attain 30.53%, 23.34%, and 32.64% higher accuracy; 20.53%, 25.34%, and 
29.64% higher precision; 20.53%, 25.34%, and 29.64% higher NP values analyzed 
with the existing for Classifying AD Stages through Brain Modifications using 
FBPINNs Optimized with sea-horse optimizer. Then, the effectiveness of the 
CAD-FBPINN technique is compared to other methods that are currently in use, 
such as AD diagnosis and classification using a convolution neural network 
algorithm (DC-AD-AlexNet), Predicting diagnosis 4 years before Alzheimer's 
disease incident (PDP-ADI-GCNN), and Using the DC-AD-AlexNet convolution neural 
network algorithm, diagnose and classify AD.

To accelerate the clinical adoption of quantitative magnetic resonance imaging 
(qMRI), frameworks are needed that not only allow for rapid acquisition, but 
also flexibility, cost efficiency, and high accuracy in parameter mapping. In 
this study, feed-forward deep neural network (DNN)- and iterative fitting-based 
frameworks are compared for multi-parametric (MP) relaxometry based on 
phase-cycled balanced steady-state free precession (pc-bSSFP) imaging. The 
performance of supervised DNNs (SVNN), self-supervised physics-informed DNNs 
(PINN), and an iterative fitting framework termed motion-insensitive rapid 
configuration relaxometry (MIRACLE) was evaluated in silico and in vivo in brain 
tissue of healthy subjects, including Monte Carlo sampling to simulate noise. 
DNNs were trained on three distinct in silico parameter distributions and at 
different signal-to-noise-ratios. The PINN framework, which incorporates 
physical knowledge into the training process, ensured more consistent inference 
and increased robustness to training data distribution compared to the SVNN. 
Furthermore, DNNs utilizing the full information of the underlying 
complex-valued MR data demonstrated ability to accelerate the data acquisition 
by a factor of 3. Whole-brain relaxometry using DNNs proved to be effective and 
adaptive, suggesting the potential for low-cost DNN retraining. This work 
emphasizes the advantages of in silico DNN MP-qMRI pipelines for rapid data 
generation and DNN training without extensive dictionary generation, long 
parameter inference times, or prolonged data acquisition, highlighting the 
flexible and rapid nature of lightweight machine learning applications for 
MP-qMRI.

Purpose To evaluate the performance of Physics-Informed Autoencoder (PIA), a 
self-supervised deep learning model, in measuring tissue-based biomarkers for 
prostate cancer (PCa) using hybrid multidimensional MRI. Materials and Methods 
This retrospective study introduces PIA, an emerging self-supervised deep 
learning model that integrates a three-compartment diffusion-relaxation model 
with hybrid multidimensional MRI. PIA was trained to encode the biophysical 
model into a deep neural network to predict measurements of tissue-specific 
biomarkers for PCa without extensive training data requirements. Comprehensive 
in silico and in vivo experiments, using histopathology measurements as the 
reference standard, were conducted to validate the model's efficacy in 
comparison to the traditional nonlinear least squares (NLLS) algorithm. PIA's 
robustness to noise was tested in in silico experiments with varying 
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, and in vivo performance for estimating 
volume fractions was evaluated in 21 patients (mean age, 60 years ± 6.6 [SD]; 
all male) with PCa (71 regions of interest). Evaluation metrics included the 
intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Pearson correlation coefficient. 
Results PIA predicted the reference standard tissue parameters with high 
accuracy, outperforming conventional NLLS methods, especially under noisy 
conditions (rs = 0.80 vs 0.65, P < .001 for epithelium volume at SNR of 20:1). 
In in vivo validation, PIA's noninvasive volume fraction estimates matched 
quantitative histology (ICC, 0.94, 0.85, and 0.92 for epithelium, stroma, and 
lumen compartments, respectively; P < .001 for all). PIA's measurements strongly 
correlated with PCa aggressiveness (r = 0.75, P < .001). Furthermore, PIA ran 
10 000 faster than NLLS (0.18 second vs 40 minutes per image). Conclusion PIA 
provided accurate prostate tissue biomarker measurements from MRI data with 
better robustness to noise and computational efficiency compared with the NLLS 
algorithm. The results demonstrate the potential of PIA as an accurate, 
noninvasive, and explainable artificial intelligence method for PCa detection.

An unsupervised machine learning method is introduced to align medical images in 
the context of the large deformation elasticity coupled with growth and 
remodeling biophysics. The technique, which stems from the principle of minimum 
potential energy in solid mechanics, consists of two steps: Firstly, in the 
predictor step, the geometric registration is achieved by minimizing a loss 
function composed of a dissimilarity measure and a regularizing term. Secondly, 
the physics of the problem, including the equilibrium equations along with 
growth mechanics, are enforced in a corrector step by minimizing the potential 
energy corresponding to a Dirichlet problem, where the predictor solution 
defines the boundary condition and is maintained by distance functions. The 
features of the new solution procedure, as well as the nature of the 
registration problem, are highlighted by considering several examples. In 
particular, registration problems containing large non-uniform deformations 
caused by extension, shearing, and bending of multiply-connected regions are 
used as benchmarks. In addition, we analyzed a benchmark biological example 
(registration for brain data) to showcase that the new deep learning method 
competes with available methods in the literature. We then applied the method to 
various datasets. First, we analyze the regrowth of the zebrafish embryonic fin 
from confocal imaging data. Next, we evaluate the quality of the solution 
procedure for two examples related to the brain. For one, we apply the new 
method for 3D image registration of longitudinal magnetic resonance images of 
the brain to assess cerebral atrophy, where a first-order ODE describes the 
volume loss mechanism. For the other, we explore cortical expansion during early 
fetal brain development by coupling the elastic deformation with morphogenetic 
growth dynamics. The method and examples show the ability of our framework to 
attain high-quality registration and, concurrently, solve large deformation 
elasticity balance equations and growth and remodeling dynamics.

BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an essential brain imaging tool, 
but its long acquisition times make it highly susceptible to motion artifacts 
that can degrade diagnostic quality.
PURPOSE: This work aims to develop and evaluate a novel physics-informed motion 
correction network, termed PI-MoCoNet, which leverages complementary information 
from both the spatial and k-space domains. The primary goal is to robustly 
remove motion artifacts from high-resolution brain MRI images without explicit 
motion parameter estimation, thereby preserving image fidelity and enhancing 
diagnostic reliability.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: PI-MoCoNet is designed as a dual-network framework 
consisting of a motion detection network and a motion correction network. The 
motion detection network employs a U-net architecture to identify corrupted 
k-space lines using a spatial averaging module, thereby reducing prediction 
uncertainty. The correction network, inspired by recent advances in U-net 
architectures and incorporating Swin Transformer blocks, reconstructs 
motion-corrected images by leveraging three loss components: the reconstruction 
loss ( L1 ), a learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) loss, and a 
data consistency loss ( Ldc ) that enforces fidelity in the k-space domain. 
Realistic motion artifacts were simulated by perturbing phase encoding lines 
with random rigid transformations. The method was evaluated on two public 
datasets (IXI and MR-ART). Comparative assessments were made against baseline 
models, including Pix2Pix GAN, CycleGAN, and a conventional U-net, using 
quantitative metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio(PSNR), structural 
similarity index measure (SSIM), and normalized mean square error (NMSE).
RESULTS: PI-MoCoNet demonstrated significant improvements over competing methods 
across all levels of motion artifacts. On the IXI dataset, for minor motion 
artifacts, PSNR improved from 34.15 dB in the motion-corrupted images to 45.95 
dB after correction, SSIM increased from 0.87 to 1.00, and NMSE was reduced from 
0.55% to 0.04%. For moderate artifacts, PSNR increased from 30.23 to 42.16 dB, 
SSIM from 0.80 to 0.99, and NMSE from 1.32% to 0.09%. In the case of heavy 
artifacts, PSNR improved from 27.99 to 36.01 dB, SSIM from 0.75 to 0.97, and 
NMSE decreased from 2.21% to 0.36%. On the MR-ART dataset, PSNR values increased 
from 23.15 to 33.01 dB for low artifact levels and from 21.23 to 31.72 dB for 
high artifact levels; concurrently, SSIM improved from 0.72 to 0.87 and from 
0.63 to 0.83, while NMSE decreased from 10.08% to 6.24% and from 14.77% to 
8.32%, respectively. An ablation study further confirmed that incorporating both 
data consistency and perceptual losses led to an approximate 1 dB gain in PSNR 
and a reduction of 0.17% in NMSE compared to using the reconstruction loss 
alone.
CONCLUSIONS: PI-MoCoNet is a robust, physics-informed framework for mitigating 
brain motion artifacts in MRI. By successfully integrating spatial and k-space 
information, it enhances image quality and reduces the likelihood of repeat 
imaging sessions due to motion-induced degradation. Its superior performance 
compared to existing methods underscores its clinical applicability, especially 
in scenarios where patient motion is inevitable, thus improving patient comfort, 
diagnostic reliability, and overall treatment planning efficiency.

Recent literature suggests that tri-exponential models may provide additional 
information and fit liver intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) data more 
accurately than conventional bi-exponential models. However, voxel-wise fitting 
of IVIM results in noisy and unreliable parameter maps. For bi-exponential IVIM, 
neural networks (NN) were able to produce superior parameter maps than 
conventional least-squares (LSQ) generated images. Hence, to improve parameter 
map quality of tri-exponential IVIM, we developed an unsupervised 
physics-informed deep neural network (IVIM3-NET). We assessed its performance in 
simulations and in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and 
compared outcomes with bi-exponential LSQ and NN fits and tri-exponential LSQ 
fits. Scanning was performed using a 3.0T free-breathing multi-slice 
diffusion-weighted single-shot echo-planar imaging sequence with 18 b-values. 
Images were analysed for visual quality, comparing the bi- and tri-exponential 
IVIM models for LSQ fits and NN fits using parameter-map signal-to-noise ratios 
(SNR) and adjusted R 2. IVIM parameters were compared to histological fibrosis, 
disease activity and steatosis grades. Parameter map quality improved with bi- 
and tri-exponential NN approaches, with a significant increase in average 
parameter-map SNR from 3.38 to 5.59 and 2.45 to 4.01 for bi- and tri-exponential 
LSQ and NN models respectively. In 33 out of 36 patients, the tri-exponential 
model exhibited higher adjusted R 2 values than the bi-exponential model. 
Correlating IVIM data to liver histology showed that the bi- and tri-exponential 
NN outperformed both LSQ models for the majority of IVIM parameters (10 out of 
15 significant correlations). Overall, our results support the use of a 
tri-exponential IVIM model in NAFLD. We show that the IVIM3-NET can be used to 
improve image quality compared to a tri-exponential LSQ fit and provides 
promising correlations with histopathology similar to the bi-exponential neural 
network fit, while generating potentially complementary additional parameters.

Objective.Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced 
magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) provide quantitative characterization of 
tissue perfusion and permeability. However, existing deep learning methods for 
PK parameter estimation rely on either temporal or spatial features alone, 
overlooking the integrated spatial-temporal characteristics of DCE-MRI data. 
This study aims to remove this barrier by fully leveraging the spatial and 
temporal information to improve parameter estimation.Approach.A spatial-temporal 
information-driven unsupervised deep learning method (STUDE) was proposed. STUDE 
combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a customized Vision 
Transformer to separately capture spatial and temporal features, enabling 
comprehensive modeling of contrast agent dynamics and tissue heterogeneity. 
Besides, a spatial-temporal attention feature fusion module was proposed to 
enable adaptive focus on both dimensions for more effective feature fusion. 
Moreover, the extended Tofts model imposed physical constraints on PK parameter 
estimation, enabling unsupervised training of STUDE. The accuracy and diagnostic 
value of STUDE was compared with the orthodox non-linear least squares (NLLS) 
and representative deep learning-based methods (i.e. gated recurrent unit, 
convolutional neural network, U-Net, and VTDCE-Net) on a numerical brain phantom 
and 87 glioma patients, respectively.Main results.On the numerical brain 
phantom, STUDE produced PK parameter maps with the lowest systematic and random 
errors even under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions (SNR = 10 dB). On 
glioma data, STUDE generated parameter maps with reduced noise compared to NLLS 
and demonstrated superior structural clarity compared to other methods. 
Furthermore, STUDE outshined all other methods in the identification of glioma 
isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation status, achieving the area under the curve 
(AUC) values at 0.840 and 0.908 for the receiver operating characteristic curves 
ofKtransand Ve, respectively. A combination of all PK parameters improved AUC to 
0.926.Significance.STUDE advances spatial-temporal information-driven and 
physics-informed learning for precise PK parameter estimation, demonstrating its 
potential clinical significance.

The potential of Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF), which allows for rapid 
and simultaneous multi-parametric quantitative MRI, is often limited by severe 
aliasing artifacts caused by aggressive undersampling. Conventional MRF 
approaches typically treat these artifacts as detrimental noise and focus on 
their removal, often at the cost of either reduced reconstruction speed or 
increased reliance on large training datasets. Building on the insight that 
structured aliasing can be leveraged as an informative spatial encoding 
mechanism, we propose to extend MRF's encoding capacity to the global 
spatio-temporal domain by introducing a novel Physics-informed implicit neural 
MRF (πMRF) framework. πMRF integrates physics-informed spatio-temporal 
fingerprint modeling with implicit neural representations (INRs), enabling 
unsupervised, gradient-driven joint estimation of quantitative tissue parameters 
and coil sensitivity maps (CSMs) with enhanced accuracy and robustness. 
Specifically, πMRF leverages a scalable component based on physics-informed 
neural networks (PINNs) to facilitate accurate high-dimensional signal modeling 
and memory-efficient optimization. In addition, a subspace-guided sensitivity 
regularization is developed to improve the robustness of CSM estimation in 
highly undersampled scenarios. Experimental results on simulated, phantom, and 
in vivo datasets demonstrate that πMRF achieves improved quantitative accuracy 
and robustness even under highly accelerated acquisitions, outperforming 
state-of-the-art MRF methods.

The circulation of cerebrospinal and interstitial fluid plays a vital role in 
clearing metabolic waste from the brain, and its disruption has been linked to 
neurological disorders. However, directly measuring brain-wide fluid 
transport-especially in the deep brain-has remained elusive. Here, we introduce 
magnetic resonance artificial intelligence velocimetry (MR-AIV), a framework 
featuring a specialized physics-informed architecture and optimization method 
that reconstructs three-dimensional fluid velocity fields from dynamic 
contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). MR-AIV unveils 
brain-wide velocity maps while providing estimates of tissue permeability and 
pressure fields-quantities inaccessible to other methods. Applied to the brain, 
MR-AIV reveals a functional landscape of interstitial and perivascular flow, 
quantitatively distinguishing slow diffusion-driven transport (~0.1 μm/s) from 
rapid advective flow (~3 μm/s). This approach enables new investigations into 
brain clearance mechanisms and fluid dynamics in health and disease, with broad 
potential applications to other porous media systems, from geophysics to tissue 
mechanics.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used radiological modality renowned 
for its radiation-free, comprehensive insights into the human body, facilitating 
medical diagnoses. However, the drawback of prolonged scan times hinders its 
accessibility. The k-space undersampling offers a solution, yet the resultant 
artifacts necessitate meticulous removal during image reconstruction. Although 
deep learning (DL) has proven effective for fast MRI image reconstruction, its 
broader applicability across various imaging scenarios has been constrained. 
Challenges include the high cost and privacy restrictions associated with 
acquiring large-scale, diverse training data, coupled with the inherent 
difficulty of addressing mismatches between training and target data in existing 
DL methodologies. Here, we present a novel Physics-Informed Synthetic data 
learning Framework for fast MRI, called PISF. PISF marks a breakthrough by 
enabling generalizable DL for multi-scenario MRI reconstruction through a single 
trained model. Our approach separates the reconstruction of a 2D image into many 
1D basic problems, commencing with 1D data synthesis to facilitate 
generalization. We demonstrate that training DL models on synthetic data, 
coupled with enhanced learning techniques, yields in vivo MRI reconstructions 
comparable to or surpassing those of models trained on matched realistic 
datasets, reducing the reliance on real-world MRI data by up to 96 %. With a 
single trained model, our PISF supports the high-quality reconstruction under 4 
sampling patterns, 5 anatomies, 6 contrasts, 5 vendors, and 7 centers, 
exhibiting remarkable generalizability. Its adaptability to 2 neuro and 2 
cardiovascular patient populations has been validated through evaluations by 10 
experienced medical professionals. In summary, PISF presents a feasible and 
cost-effective way to significantly boost the widespread adoption of DL in 
various fast MRI applications.

Magnetic resonance (MR) tagging is an imaging technique for noninvasively 
tracking tissue motion in vivo by creating a visible pattern of magnetization 
saturation (tags) that deforms with the tissue. Due to longitudinal relaxation 
and progression to steady-state, the tags and tissue brightnesses change over 
time, which makes tracking with optical flow methods error-prone. Although 
Fourier methods can alleviate these problems, they are also sensitive to 
brightness changes as well as spectral spreading due to motion. To address these 
problems, we introduce the brightness-invariant tracking estimation (BRITE) 
technique for tagged MRI. BRITE disentangles the anatomy from the tag pattern in 
the observed tagged image sequence and simultaneously estimates the Lagrangian 
motion. The inherent ill-posedness of this problem is addressed by leveraging 
the expressive power of denoising diffusion probabilistic models to represent 
the probabilistic distribution of the underlying anatomy and the flexibility of 
physics-informed neural networks to estimate biologically-plausible motion. A 
set of tagged MR images of a gel phantom was acquired with various tag periods 
and imaging flip angles to demonstrate the impact of brightness variations and 
to validate our method. The results show that BRITE achieves more accurate 
motion and strain estimates as compared to other state of the art methods, while 
also being resistant to tag fading.

Investigating Multiple Physical Priors in Deep Learning for Electrical 
Properties Reconstruction in MREPT.

Zheng M, Zhang X.

Magnetic Resonance Electrical Properties Tomography (MREPT) is a valuable 
imaging modality for non-invasive, in-vivo mapping of conductivity and 
permittivity. While deep learning (DL) based MREPT methods help mitigate the 
sensitivity and artifact issues of traditional approaches, their reliability and 
generalization remain significant challenges, limiting clinical applicability. 
To address these issues, this study integrates physics-informed constraints into 
network training, incorporating gradient similarity, Helmholtz equation 
constraints, complex arithmetic operations, and prior knowledge of curl and 
Laplacian operators. A quantitative analysis of different physical priors is 
conducted to assess their impact on reconstruction accuracy and model 
generalization. The proposed physics-informed deep learning framework 
demonstrates improved generalization and predictive accuracy, achieving 
promising results in real human head EP reconstruction. These findings suggest 
that multi-physical constraint can enhance the robustness of DL-based MREPT, 
paving the way for future clinical applications.Clinical Relevance- This study 
improves the accuracy and reliability of deep learning-based MREPT, enhancing 
its potential for non-invasive brain conductivity and permittivity mapping in 
clinical applications.

clinical applications, but current learning-based methods often rely on simple 
smoothness losses. This can produce physically implausible deformations, such as 
tissue folding, and creates a trade-off between registration accuracy and 
anatomical correctness. The objective of this study is to develop and validate a 
novel, physics-informed regularizer that simultaneously improves both the 
accuracy and physical plausibility of learning-based registration with 
negligible computational overhead.
METHODS: We propose ElasticMorph, a plug-and-play loss function derived from the 
Navier-Cauchy equation. This regularizer penalizes both curvature and divergence 
in the deformation field. We derive an approximation based, measure theoretic 
bound under small strain assumptions, which links the elastic residual to an 
upper bound on the number of negative Jacobian voxels. This gives a principled 
and differentiable surrogate for folding control. The method was evaluated on 
two public brain MRI benchmarks (IXI and LPBA-40) by integrating it into four 
state-of-the-art CNN and transformer backbones. Performance was quantified using 
the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and the percentage of negative Jacobians 
(%negJ), with statistical significance assessed via paired t-tests.
RESULTS: Across all tested backbones and datasets, ElasticMorph consistently 
improved registration accuracy, increasing the mean DSC by 0.56-4.92 %. 
Concurrently, it suppressed folding artifacts, reducing the %negJ by 24%-42%. 
This was achieved with a minimal increase in training time ≤8% and memory ≤15%, 
and no cost at inference. Ablation studies confirmed that the combined 
curvature-divergence loss outperformed either component alone. A hyperparameter 
sweep revealed a broad optimal range, with folding artifacts monotonically 
decreasing as regularization strength increased, consistent with our theoretical 
proof.
CONCLUSIONS: Enforcing second-order linear elasticity offers a robust and 
computationally efficient strategy to overcome the limitations of conventional 
regularizers. ElasticMorph provides a practical, principled, and plug-and-play 
solution for developing more accurate and physically plausible registration 
models, holding significant potential for improving the reliability of 
downstream biomedical image analysis tasks. The code will be made publicly 
available.

PURPOSE: T2∗ quantification from gradient echo magnetic resonance imaging is 
particularly affected by subject motion due to its high sensitivity to magnetic 
field inhomogeneities, which are influenced by motion and might cause signal 
loss. Thus, motion correction is crucial to obtain high-quality T2∗ maps.
METHODS: We extend PHIMO, our previously introduced learning-based 
physics-informed motion correction method for low-resolution T2∗ mapping. Our 
extended version, PHIMO+, utilizes acquisition knowledge to enhance the 
reconstruction performance for challenging motion patterns and increase PHIMO's 
robustness to varying strengths of magnetic field inhomogeneities across the 
brain. We perform comprehensive evaluations regarding motion detection accuracy 
and image quality for data with simulated and real motion.
RESULTS: PHIMO+ outperforms the learning-based baseline methods both 
qualitatively and quantitatively with respect to line detection and image 
quality. Moreover, PHIMO+ performs on par with a conventional state-of-the-art 
motion correction method for T2∗ quantification from gradient echo MRI, which 
relies on redundant data acquisition.
CONCLUSION: PHIMO+'s competitive motion correction performance, combined with a 
reduction in acquisition time by over 40% compared to the state-of-the-art 
method, makes it a promising solution for motion-robust T2∗ quantification in 
research settings and clinical routine.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this work was to develop and evaluate a novel method 
that leverages neural networks and physical modeling for 3D motion correction at 
different levels of corruption.
METHODS: The novel method (""UNet+JE"") combines an existing neural network 
(""UNetmag"") with a physics-informed algorithm for jointly estimating motion 
parameters and the motion-compensated image (""JE""). UNetmag and UNet+JE were 
trained on two training datasets separately with different distributions of 
motion corruption severity and compared to JE as a benchmark. All five resulting 
methods were tested on T1w 3D MPRAGE scans of healthy participants with 
simulated (n = 40) and in vivo (n = 10) motion corruption ranging from mild to 
severe motion.
RESULTS: UNet+JE provided better motion correction than UNetmag ( p < 10-2 for 
all metrics for both simulated and in vivo data), under both training datasets. 
UNetmag exhibited residual image artifacts and blurring, as well as greater 
susceptibility to data distribution shifts than UNet+JE. UNet+JE and JE did not 
significantly differ in image correction quality ( p > 0.05 for all metrics), 
even under strong distribution shifts for UNet+JE. However, UNet+JE reduced 
runtimes by a median reduction factor of between 2.00 to 3.80 as well as 4.05 
for the simulation and in vivo studies, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: UNet+JE benefitted from the robustness of joint estimation and the 
fast image improvement provided by the neural network, enabling the method to 
provide high quality 3D image correction under a wide range of motion corruption 
within shorter runtimes.

Hemodynamic analysis is crucial for diagnosing and predicting cardiovascular diseases. However, methods relying on fluid flow simulations or blood flow imaging are complex, time-consuming, and require specialized expertise, limiting their clinical use.
Goal:
This research aims to automate the enhancement of blood flow images, providing clinicians with a fast, accurate tool for hemodynamic analysis without requiring advanced expertise.
Objectives:
A software tool based on physics-constrained neural networks was developed to enable clinicians to easily select and process regions of interest (ROIs) in time-resolved three-dimensional phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (4D-Flow MRI) blood flow images for quick, accurate analysis.
Methods:
The Input Parameterized Physics-Informed Neural Network (IP-PINN) was introduced to improve the spatio-temporal resolution of 4D-Flow MRI. IP-PINN mitigates noise, velocity aliasing, and phase errors. A convolutional neural network processes ROI data into latent vectors, which are then used to predict velocity, pressure, and spin density via a multi-layer perceptron. The method is trained with synthetic blood flow data using an innovative loss function that addresses noise and artifacts.
Results:
IP-PINN successfully enhanced image resolution, reducing noise and artifacts when tested on synthetic 4D-Flow MRI data derived from blood flow simulations of intracranial aneurysms. For data with 20 decibels (dB) signal-to-noise ratio, results closely matched the ground truth with less than 5.5% relative error. Processing took under two minutes. The method also has the potential to reduce data acquisition time by 25%.
Conclusions:
IP-PINN could significantly enhance the clinical use of 4D-Flow MRI for personalized hemodynamic analysis in cardiovascular diseases."

Comprehending the biomechanical characteristics of the human lumbar spine is crucial for managing and preventing spinal disorders. Precise material properties derived from patient-specific CT scans are essential for simulations to accurately mimic real-life scenarios, which is invaluable in creating effective surgical plans. The integration of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offers significant clinical benefits by automating lumbar spine segmentation and meshing.
Methods
We developed a FEA model of the lumbar spine incorporating detailed anatomical and material properties derived from high-quality CT and MRI scans. The model includes vertebrae and intervertebral discs, segmented and meshed using advanced imaging and computational techniques. PINNs were implemented to integrate physical laws directly into the neural network training process, ensuring that the predictions of material properties adhered to the governing equations of mechanics.
Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 94.30% in predicting material properties such as Young's modulus (14.88 GPa for cortical bone and 1.23 MPa for intervertebral discs), Poisson's ratio (0.25 and 0.47, respectively), bulk modulus (9.87 GPa and 6.56 MPa, respectively), and shear modulus (5.96 GPa and 0.42 MPa, respectively). We developed a lumbar spine FEA model using anatomical and material properties from CT and MRI scans. Vertebrae and discs were segmented and meshed with advanced imaging techniques, while PINNs ensured material predictions followed mechanical laws.
Conclusions
The integration of FEA and PINNs allows for accurate, automated prediction of material properties and mechanical behaviors of the lumbar spine, significantly reducing manual input and enhancing reliability. This approach ensures dependable biomechanical simulations and supports the development of personalized treatment plans and surgical strategies, ultimately improving clinical outcomes for spinal disorders. This method improves surgical planning and outcomes, contributing to better patient care and recovery in spinal disorders."
W00087,PINN-DADif: Physics-informed deep adaptive diffusion network for robust and efficient MRI reconstruction,,2025,journal,Digital Signal Processing A Review Journal,160,,10.1016/j.dsp.2025.105085,,,,Scopus,"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is essential for high-resolution soft-tissue imaging but suffers from long acquisition times, limiting its clinical efficiency. Accelerating MRI through undersampling k-space data leads to ill-posed inverse problems, introducing noise and artifacts that degrade image quality. Conventional deep learning models, including conditional and unconditional approaches, often face challenges in generalization, particularly with variations in imaging operators or domain shifts. In this study, we propose PINN-DADif, a Physics-Informed Neural Network integrated with deep adaptive diffusion priors, to address these challenges in MRI reconstruction. PINN-DADif employs a two-phase inference strategy: an initial rapid-diffusion phase for fast preliminary reconstructions, followed by an adaptive phase where the diffusion prior is refined to ensure consistency with MRI physics and data fidelity. The inclusion of physics-based regularization through PINNs enhances the model's adherence to k-space constraints and gradient smoothness, leading to more accurate reconstructions. This adaptive approach reduces the number of iterations required compared to traditional diffusion models, improving both speed and image quality. We validated PINN-DADif on a private MRI dataset and the public fastMRI dataset, where it outperformed state-of-the-art methods. The model achieved PSNR values of 41.2, 39.5, and 41.5, and SSIM values of 98.7, 98.0, and 98.5 for T1, T2, and Proton Density-weighted images at R = 4x on the private dataset. Similar high performance was observed on the fastMRI dataset, even in scenarios involving domain shifts. PINN-DADif marks a significant advancement in MRI reconstruction by providing an efficient, adaptive, and physics-informed solution."

Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for solving inverse problems, especially in cases where no complete information about the system is known and scatter measurements are available. This is especially useful in hemodynamics since the boundary information is often difficult to model, and high-quality blood flow measurements are generally hard to obtain.
Methods:
In this work, we use the PINNs methodology for estimating reduced-order model parameters and the full velocity field from scatter 2D noisy measurements in the aorta. Two different flow regimes, stationary and transient were studied.
Results:
We show robust and relatively accurate parameter estimations when using the method with simulated data, while the velocity reconstruction accuracy shows dependence on the measurement quality and the flow pattern complexity. Comparison with a Kalman filter approach shows similar results when the number of parameters to be estimated is low to medium. For a higher number of parameters, only PINNs were capable of achieving good results.
Conclusion:
The method opens a door to deep-learning-driven methods in the simulations of complex coupled physical systems."

This study focused on patients with abnormal mammogram findings or a clinical suspicion of breast cancer, exclusively those confirmed by biopsy. Utilizing an ultra-high sensitivity thermal camera and prone patient positioning, we measured surface temperatures integrated with an inverse modeling technique based on heat transfer principles to predict malignant breast lesions. Involving 25 breast tumors, our technique accurately predicted all tumors, with maximum errors below 5 mm in size and less than 1 cm in tumor location. Predictive efficacy was unaffected by tumor size, location, or breast density, with no aberrant predictions in the contralateral normal breast. Infrared temperature profiles and inverse modeling using both techniques successfully predicted breast cancer, highlighting its potential in breast cancer screening.</jats:p>"
W00100,Neuromorphic Computing Network for Underwater Image Enhancement and Beyond,,2024,journal,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,62,,10.1109/TGRS.2024.3473020,,,,Scopus,"Optical remote sensing serves as a critical technology for exploring underwater environments. However, light absorption and scattering underwater significantly degrade underwater optical images, affecting the extraction and analysis of information. Underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods aim to eliminate this degradation and improve the visual quality of images. Nonetheless, the complex and dynamic underwater imaging environment, limited computing resources, and scarce training data/data pairs restrict the practical application of existing methods. To solve these problems, we propose an UIE network (UIEN) based on neuromorphic computing, which simulates the pathway of the visual system to perceive and process light information, and can use a lightweight network structure to achieve good performance through unsupervised learning. Specifically, we propose a visual perception module comprising a 2-D Duffing oscillator (2D-DO) with pixel-wise potential barrier parameters. This module can generate the stochastic resonance (SR) phenomenon to enhance the degraded image. Inspired by physics-informed learning, a dual-path neural network is employed to estimate the potential barrier parameters and solve the partial differential equation (PDE) that describes the visual perception module. Subsequently, we introduce three nonreference (NR) losses to guide the network training and improve the enhanced image’s visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve outstanding performance with less computing resource cost compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Furthermore, we examine the generalization and versatility of the proposed method to establish its reliability across various degradation types and tasks in practical applications of optical remote sensing."

Methods: Utilising knowledge about the underlying physics, a novel network architecture (SH-Net) is introduced which involves the estimation of spherical harmonic coefficients to guarantee a spatially smooth field map estimate. The SH-Net is integrated in an end-to-end trainable model which jointly estimates the B0-field map as well as the image. Experiments were conducted on retrospectively simulated low-field data of human knees. Results: We compare our model to different model-based approaches at distinct noise levels and various B0-field distributions. Our results show that our physics-informed neural network approach outperforms the purely model-based methods by improving the PSNR up to 11.7% and the RMSE up to 86.3%. Conclusion: Our end-to-end trained model-based approach outperforms existing methods in reconstructing image and B0-field maps in the low-field regime. Significance: low-field MRI is becoming increasingly more popular as it enables access to MR in challenging situations such as intensive care units or resource poor areas. Our method allows for fast and accurate image reconstruction in such low-field imaging with B0-inhomogeneity compensation under a wide range of various environmental conditions."
W00109,MRI-MECH: mechanics-informed MRI to estimate esophageal health,,2023,journal,Frontiers in Physiology,14,,10.3389/fphys.2023.1195067,,,,Scopus,"Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a popular medical imaging technique that generates image sequences of the flow of a contrast material inside tissues and organs. However, its application to imaging bolus movement through the esophagus has only been demonstrated in few feasibility studies and is relatively unexplored. In this work, we present a computational framework called mechanics-informed MRI (MRI-MECH) that enhances that capability, thereby increasing the applicability of dynamic MRI for diagnosing esophageal disorders. Pineapple juice was used as the swallowed contrast material for the dynamic MRI, and the MRI image sequence was used as input to the MRI-MECH. The MRI-MECH modeled the esophagus as a flexible one-dimensional tube, and the elastic tube walls followed a linear tube law. Flow through the esophagus was governed by one-dimensional mass and momentum conservation equations. These equations were solved using a physics-informed neural network. The physics-informed neural network minimized the difference between the measurements from the MRI and model predictions and ensured that the physics of the fluid flow problem was always followed. MRI-MECH calculated the fluid velocity and pressure during esophageal transit and estimated the mechanical health of the esophagus by calculating wall stiffness and active relaxation. Additionally, MRI-MECH predicted missing information about the lower esophageal sphincter during the emptying process, demonstrating its applicability to scenarios with missing data or poor image resolution. In addition to potentially improving clinical decisions based on quantitative estimates of the mechanical health of the esophagus, MRI-MECH can also be adapted for application to other medical imaging modalities to enhance their functionality.

W00110,Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN) for Low Snr Magnetic Resonance Electrical Properties Tomography (MREPT),,2022,journal,Diagnostics,12,11.0,10.3390/diagnostics12112627,,,,Scopus,"Electrical properties (EPs) of tissues facilitate early detection of cancerous tissues. Magnetic resonance electrical properties tomography (MREPT) is a technique to non-invasively probe the EPs of tissues from MRI measurements. Most MREPT methods rely on numerical differentiation (ND) to solve partial differential Equations (PDEs) to reconstruct the EPs. However, they are not practical for clinical data because ND is noise sensitive and the MRI measurements for MREPT are noisy in nature. Recently, Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) have been introduced to solve PDEs by substituting ND with automatic differentiation (AD). To the best of our knowledge, it has not been applied to MREPT due to the challenges in using PINN on MREPT as (i) a PINN requires part of ground-truth EPs as collocation points to optimize the network’s AD, (ii) the noisy input data disrupts the optimization of PINNs despite the noise-filtering nature of NNs and additional denoising processes. In this work, we propose a PINN-MREPT model based on a canonical analytic MREPT model. A reference padding layer with known EPs was added to surround the region of interest for providing additive collocation points. Moreover, an optimizable diffusion coefficient was embedded in the analytic MREPT model used in the PINN-MREPT. The noise robustness of the proposed PINN-MREPT for single-sample reconstruction was tested by using numerical phantoms of human brain with extra tumor-like tissues at different noise levels. The results of numerical experiments show that PINN-MREPT outperforms two typical numerical MREPT methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy, sensitivity to the extra tissues, and the correlations of line profiles in the regions of interest. The advantage of the PINN-MREPT is shown by the results of an experiment on phantom measurement, too. Moreover, it is found that the diffusion term plays an important role to achieve a noise-robust PINN-MREPT. This is an important step moving forward to a clinical application of MREPT."

As is well-known, this problem was firstly studied by Robinson and Josephy in the 70’s. Since then, it has been extensively studied by many other researchers, specially Dontchev and Rockafellar. Here, we propose two Broyden-type quasi-Newton approaches to dealing with constrained generalized equations, one that requires the exact resolution of the subproblems, and other that allows inexactness, which is closer to numerical reality. In both cases, projections onto the feasible set are also inexact. The local convergence of general quasi-Newton approaches is established under a bounded deterioration of the update matrix and Lipschitz continuity hypotheses. In particular, we prove that a general scheme converges linearly to the solution under suitable assumptions. Furthermore, when a Broyden-type update rule is used, the convergence is superlinearly. Some numerical examples illustrate the applicability of the proposed methods.</jats:p>"
