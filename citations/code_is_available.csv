Based on the abstracts provided in `PINN_MRI_master.csv`, I have identified which works explicitly mention the availability of source code.

Here is the CSV file containing the work ID, a binary indicator of code availability (`code_available`), and the link or statement found in the abstract (`code_link_or_note`).

**Key findings:**
*   **Explicit Links:** Only **W00006**, **W00028**, and **W00038** provide direct GitHub links in their abstracts.
*   **Promised Code:** **W00052** explicitly states "The code will be made publicly available," though no URL is present in the abstract text.
*   **No Mention:** The majority of the abstracts do not explicitly state that the code is open source or provide a URL, although some mention using standard frameworks (Python, etc.) or having supplemental material.
