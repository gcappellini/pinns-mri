https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01542,Reconstruction of instantaneous flow fields from transient velocity snapshots using physics-informed neural networks: Applications to pulsatile blood flow behind a stenosis,"Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a promising framework by embedding partial differential equations (PDEs) into the loss function together with measurement data, making them well-suited for inverse problems. However, standard PINNs face challenges with time-dependent PDEs due to the high computational cost of space-time training and the risk of convergence to local minima. These limitations are particularly pronounced in hemodynamic analysis, where 4D-flow magnetic resonance imaging (4D-flow MRI) yields temporally sparse velocity snapshots over the cardiac cycle. To address this challenge, we propose a PINN framework that reconstructs instantaneous flow fields from transient velocity snapshots by inferring the acceleration term in the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. By designing the network without explicit time as an input, the proposed approach enables physics enforcement using spatial evaluations alone, improving training efficiency while maintaining physical consistency with transient flow characteristics. In addition, we introduce an acceleration-mismatch loss that penalizes discrepancies between predicted and measured accelerations, which improves prediction accuracy through regularization. Numerical examples on pulsatile flow behind a stenosis using temporally and spatially downsampled synthetic data generated from time-resolved CFD demonstrate that the proposed framework reliably reconstructs velocity fields even under sparse temporal sampling, and appropriate regularization for acceleration improves predictions of pressure-gradient and acceleration fields.",2026-02-02T10:15:00Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01542
http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14211v1,Error Bound Analysis of Physics-Informed Neural Networks-Driven T2 Quantification in Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) are emerging as a promising approach for quantitative parameter estimation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). While existing deep learning methods can provide an accurate quantitative estimation of the T2 parameter, they still require large amounts of training data and lack theoretical support and a recognized gold standard. Thus, given the absence of PINN-based approaches for T2 estimation, we propose embedding the fundamental physics of MRI, the Bloch equation, in the loss of PINN, which is solely based on target scan data and does not require a pre-defined training database. Furthermore, by deriving rigorous upper bounds for both the T2 estimation error and the generalization error of the Bloch equation solution, we establish a theoretical foundation for evaluating the PINN's quantitative accuracy. Even without access to the ground truth or a gold standard, this theory enables us to estimate the error with respect to the real quantitative parameter T2. The accuracy of T2 mapping and the validity of the theoretical analysis are demonstrated on a numerical cardiac model and a water phantom, where our method exhibits excellent quantitative precision in the myocardial T2 range. Clinical applicability is confirmed in 94 acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients, achieving low-error quantitative T2 estimation under the theoretical error bound, highlighting the robustness and potential of PINN.",2025-12-16T09:09:27Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14211v1

However, single-orientation QSM inversion remains highly ill-posed because the dipole kernel exhibits a cone-null region in the Fourier domain, leading to streaking artifacts and structural loss. To overcome this limitation, we propose QSMnet-INR, a deep, physics-informed framework that integrates an Implicit Neural Representation (INR) into the k-space domain. The INR module continuously models multi-directional dipole responses and explicitly completes the cone-null region, while a frequency-domain residual-weighted Dipole Loss enforces physical consistency. The overall network combines a 3D U-Net-based QSMnet backbone with the INR module through alternating optimization for end-to-end joint training. Experiments on the 2016 QSM Reconstruction Challenge, a multi-orientation GRE dataset, and both in-house and public single-orientation clinical data demonstrate that QSMnet-INR consistently outperforms conventional and recent deep-learning approaches across multiple quantitative metrics. The proposed framework shows notable advantages in structural recovery within cone-null regions and in artifact suppression. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary contributions of the INR module and Dipole Loss to detail preservation and physical stability. Overall, QSMnet-INR effectively alleviates the ill-posedness of single-orientation QSM without requiring multi-orientation acquisition, achieving high accuracy, robustness, and strong cross-scenario generalization-highlighting its potential for clinical translation.",2025-12-12T08:57:21Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09425

Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency. Experimental results on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and real 4D flow MRI datasets demonstrate that PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy.

Strain analysis informed with the orientation of fibers allows to describe several pathologies that are typically associated with impaired mechanics of the myocardium, such as cardiovascular disease. Several methods have been developed to estimate strain-derived metrics from traditional imaging techniques. However, the physical models underlying these methods do not include fiber mechanics, restricting their capacity to accurately explain cardiac function. In this work, we introduce WarpPINN-fibers, a physics-informed neural network framework to accurately obtain cardiac motion and strains enhanced by fiber information. We train our neural network to satisfy a hyper-elastic model and promote fiber contraction with the goal to predict the deformation field of the heart from cine magnetic resonance images. For this purpose, we build a loss function composed of three terms: a data-similarity loss between the reference and the warped template images, a regularizer enforcing near-incompressibility of cardiac tissue and a fiber-stretch penalization that controls strain in the direction of synthetically produced fibers. We show that our neural network improves the former WarpPINN model and effectively controls fiber stretch in a synthetic phantom experiment. Then, we demonstrate that WarpPINN-fibers outperforms alternative methodologies in landmark-tracking and strain curve prediction for a cine-MRI benchmark with a cohort of 15 healthy volunteers. We expect that our method will enable a more precise quantification of cardiac strains through accurate deformation fields that are consistent with fiber physiology, without requiring imaging techniques more sophisticated than MRI.",2025-09-10T14:53:31Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08872v1

We use PINNs to estimate smooth velocity and pressure fields from synthetic 4D flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. We analyze five non-Newtonian dynamic 3D blood flow cases within a realistic aortic model, covering a range of hematocrit values from anemic to polycythemic conditions. To enhance state estimation results, we consider various design and training techniques for PINNs, including adaptive loss balancing, curriculum training, and a realistic measurement operator. Regarding blood rheology, the PINN approach accurately estimates viscosity globally and locally under peak systolic conditions. It also provides a clear pattern recognition for diastolic stages. Regarding mass conservation, PINN estimations effectively reproduce the bifurcation of flow through the different branches of the aorta, demonstrate an excellent representation of the non-slip conditions at the walls, and accurately estimate pressure drops with relative errors below the 5% in the whole pressure field. We test our pressure drop estimations against the state of the art Virtual Work Energy Relative Pressure (vWERP) estimator, and we observe how our results outperform vWERP in terms of both accuracy and time resolution. Additionally, we find that the best results are achieved by computing the velocity field using the PINN, which is then integrated into the vWERP framework, leading to time super-sampled and high-order approximations, with a clinically admissible accuracy.",2025-08-05T11:07:33Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03326v1

Due to longitudinal relaxation and progression to steady-state, the tags and tissue brightnesses change over time, which makes tracking with optical flow methods error-prone. Although Fourier methods can alleviate these problems, they are also sensitive to brightness changes as well as spectral spreading due to motion. To address these problems, we introduce the brightness-invariant tracking estimation (BRITE) technique for tagged MRI. BRITE disentangles the anatomy from the tag pattern in the observed tagged image sequence and simultaneously estimates the Lagrangian motion. The inherent ill-posedness of this problem is addressed by leveraging the expressive power of denoising diffusion probabilistic models to represent the probabilistic distribution of the underlying anatomy and the flexibility of physics-informed neural networks to estimate biologically-plausible motion. A set of tagged MR images of a gel phantom was acquired with various tag periods and imaging flip angles to demonstrate the impact of brightness variations and to validate our method. The results show that BRITE achieves more accurate motion and strain estimates as compared to other state of the art methods, while also being resistant to tag fading.",2025-05-23T20:48:23Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18365v1

In the present work, we study Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), and their Physics-Informed extensions (PI-DeepONets) in predicting vascular flow simulations in the context of a 3D Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) idealized model. PINN is a technique that combines deep neural networks with the fundamental principles of physics, incorporating the physics laws, which are given as partial differential equations, directly into loss functions used during the training process. On the other hand, DeepONet is designed to learn nonlinear operators from data and is particularly useful in studying parametric partial differential equations (PDEs), e.g., families of PDEs with different source terms, boundary conditions, or initial conditions. Here, we adapt the approaches to address the particular use case of AAA by integrating the 3D Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) as the physical laws governing fluid dynamics. In addition, we follow best practices to enhance the capabilities of the models by effectively capturing the underlying physics of the problem under study. The advantages and limitations of each approach are highlighted through a series of relevant application cases. We validate our results by comparing them with CFD simulations for benchmark datasets, demonstrating good agreements and emphasizing those cases where improvements in computational efficiency are observed.",2025-03-19T22:38:52Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17402v1

However, cerebral blood flow (CBF) estimation in infants using ASL remains challenging due to the complex interplay of network physiology, involving dynamic interactions between cardiac output and cerebral perfusion, as well as issues with parameter uncertainty and data noise. We propose a new spatial uncertainty-based physics-informed neural network (PINN), SUPINN, to estimate CBF and other parameters from infant ASL data. SUPINN employs a multi-branch architecture to concurrently estimate regional and global model parameters across multiple voxels. It computes regional spatial uncertainties to weigh the signal. SUPINN can reliably estimate CBF (relative error $-0.3 \pm 71.7$), bolus arrival time (AT) ($30.5 \pm 257.8$), and blood longitudinal relaxation time ($T_{1b}$) ($-4.4 \pm 28.9$), surpassing parameter estimates performed using least squares or standard PINNs. Furthermore, SUPINN produces physiologically plausible spatially smooth CBF and AT maps. Our study demonstrates the successful modification of PINNs for accurate multi-parameter perfusion estimation from noisy and limited ASL data in infants. Frameworks like SUPINN have the potential to advance our understanding of the complex cardio-brain network physiology, aiding in the detection and management of diseases.

Non-invasive, in-vivo measurement of these quantities can only be performed using a select number of modalities that are not widely available, such as 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this work, we create a surrogate model for hemodynamic flow field estimation, powered by machine learning. We train graph neural networks that include priors about the underlying symmetries and physics, limiting the amount of data required for training. This allows us to train the model using moderately-sized, in-vivo 4D flow MRI datasets, instead of large in-silico datasets obtained by computational fluid dynamics (CFD), as is the current standard. We create an efficient, equivariant neural network by combining the popular PointNet++ architecture with group-steerable layers. To incorporate the physics-informed priors, we derive an efficient discretisation scheme for the involved differential operators. We perform extensive experiments in carotid arteries and show that our model can accurately estimate low-noise hemodynamic flow fields in the carotid artery. Moreover, we show how the learned relation between geometry and hemodynamic quantities transfers to 3D vascular models obtained using a different imaging modality than the training data. This shows that physics-informed graph neural networks can be trained using 4D flow MRI data to estimate blood flow in unseen carotid artery geometries.",2024-08-13T13:09:28Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07110v1

Although existing methods have enhanced decoding capabilities, limitations remain in information utilization and model representation. To overcome these challenges, we propose an innovative multi-task learning model, Physics-informed Embedding Network with Multi-Task Transformer (PEMT-Net), which enhances decoding performance through physics-informed embedding and deep learning techniques. PEMT-Net consists of two principal components: feature augmentation and classification. For feature augmentation, we propose a novel approach by creating neural embedding graphs via node embedding, utilizing random walks to simulate the physical diffusion of neural information. This method captures both local and non-local information overflow and proposes a position encoding based on relative physical coordinates. In the classification segment, we propose adaptive embedding fusion to maximally capture linear and non-linear characteristics. Furthermore, we propose an innovative parameter-sharing mechanism to optimize the retention and learning of extracted features. Experiments on a specific dataset demonstrate PEMT-Net's significant performance in multi-task auditory signal decoding, surpassing existing methods and offering new insights into the brain's mechanisms for processing complex auditory information.",2024-06-03T08:57:23Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02014

It plays a pivotal role in high-level brain functions such as memory, emotion, and sensation. However, the specific form of molecular transport within the ECS remain elusive. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel approach to quantitatively analyze the molecular transport within the ECS by solving an inverse problem derived from the advection-diffusion equation (ADE) using a physics-informed neural network (PINN). PINN provides a streamlined solution to the ADE without the need for intricate mathematical formulations or grid settings. Additionally, the optimization of PINN facilitates the automatic computation of the diffusion coefficient governing long-term molecule transport and the velocity of molecules driven by advection. Consequently, the proposed method allows for the quantitative analysis and identification of the specific pattern of molecular transport within the ECS through the calculation of the Peclet number. Experimental validation on two datasets of magnetic resonance images (MRIs) captured at different time points showcases the effectiveness of the proposed method. Notably, our simulations reveal identical molecular transport patterns between datasets representing rats with tracer injected into the same brain region.

Yet, the clinical utility of DWI data is hindered by unavoidable fetal motion during acquisition. We present IVIM-morph, a self-supervised deep neural network model for motion-corrected quantitative analysis of DWI data using the Intra-voxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) model. IVIM-morph combines two sub-networks, a registration sub-network, and an IVIM model fitting sub-network, enabling simultaneous estimation of IVIM model parameters and motion. To promote physically plausible image registration, we introduce a biophysically informed loss function that effectively balances registration and model-fitting quality. We validated the efficacy of IVIM-morph by establishing a correlation between the predicted IVIM model parameters of the lung and gestational age (GA) using fetal DWI data of 39 subjects. IVIM-morph exhibited a notably improved correlation with gestational age (GA) when performing in-vivo quantitative analysis of fetal lung DWI data during the canalicular phase.

Quantifying local deformations in the form of cardiac strain can provide helpful information, but it remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce WarpPINN, a physics-informed neural network to perform image registration to obtain local metrics of the heart deformation. We apply this method to cine magnetic resonance images to estimate the motion during the cardiac cycle. We inform our neural network of near-incompressibility of cardiac tissue by penalizing the jacobian of the deformation field. The loss function has two components: an intensity-based similarity term between the reference and the warped template images, and a regularizer that represents the hyperelastic behavior of the tissue. The architecture of the neural network allows us to easily compute the strain via automatic differentiation to assess cardiac activity. We use Fourier feature mappings to overcome the spectral bias of neural networks, allowing us to capture discontinuities in the strain field. We test our algorithm on a synthetic example and on a cine-MRI benchmark of 15 healthy volunteers. We outperform current methodologies both landmark tracking and strain estimation.

However, its application to imaging bolus movement through the esophagus has only been demonstrated in few feasibility studies and is relatively unexplored. In this work, we present a computational framework called mechanics-informed MRI (MRI-MECH) that enhances that capability thereby increasing the applicability of dynamic MRI for diagnosing esophageal disorders. Pineapple juice was used as the swallowed contrast material for the dynamic MRI and the MRI image sequence was used as input to the MRI-MECH. The MRI-MECH modeled the esophagus as a flexible one-dimensional tube and the elastic tube walls followed a linear tube law. Flow through the esophagus was then governed by one-dimensional mass and momentum conservation equations. These equations were solved using a physics-informed neural network (PINN). The PINN minimized the difference between the measurements from the MRI and model predictions ensuring that the physics of the fluid flow problem was always followed. MRI-MECH calculated the fluid velocity and pressure during esophageal transit and estimated the mechanical health of the esophagus by calculating wall stiffness and active relaxation. Additionally, MRI-MECH predicted missing information about the lower esophageal sphincter during the emptying process, demonstrating its applicability to scenarios with missing data or poor image resolution. In addition to potentially improving clinical decisions based on quantitative estimates of the mechanical health of the esophagus, MRI-MECH can also be enhanced for application to other medical imaging modalities to enhance their functionality as well.",2022-09-15T08:57:23Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07492

We apply physics-informed neural networks as well as the finite element method to estimate the diffusion coefficient governing the long term, i.e. over days, spread of molecules in the human brain from a novel magnetic resonance imaging technique. Synthetic testcases are created to demonstrate that the standard formulation of the physics-informed neural network faces challenges with noisy measurements in our application. Our numerical results demonstrate that the residual of the partial differential equation after training needs to be small in order to obtain accurate recovery of the diffusion coefficient. To achieve this, we apply several strategies such as tuning the weights and the norms used in the loss function as well as residual based adaptive refinement and exchange of residual training points. We find that the diffusion coefficient estimated with PINNs from magnetic resonance images becomes consistent with results from a finite element based approach when the residuum after training becomes small.

This study introduces physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) as a means to perform myocardial perfusion MR quantification, which provides a versatile scheme for the inference of kinetic parameters. These neural networks can be trained to fit the observed perfusion MR data while respecting the underlying physical conservation laws described by a multi-compartment exchange model. Here, we provide a framework for the implementation of PINNs in myocardial perfusion MR.   The approach is validated both in silico and in vivo. In the in silico study, an overall reduction in mean-squared error with the ground-truth parameters was observed compared to a standard non-linear least squares fitting approach. The in vivo study demonstrates that the method produces parameter values comparable to those previously found in literature, as well as providing parameter maps which match the clinical diagnosis of patients.",2020-11-25T16:02:52Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12844v3
http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10767v1,Physics-informed brain MRI segmentation,"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is one of the most flexible and powerful medical imaging modalities. This flexibility does however come at a cost; MRI images acquired at different sites and with different parameters exhibit significant differences in contrast and tissue appearance, resulting in downstream issues when quantifying brain anatomy or the presence of pathology. In this work, we propose to combine multiparametric MRI-based static-equation sequence simulations with segmentation convolutional neural networks (CNN), to make these networks robust to variations in acquisition parameters. Results demonstrate that, when given both the image and their associated physics acquisition parameters, CNNs can produce segmentations that exhibit robustness to acquisition variations. We also show that the proposed physics-informed methods can be used to bridge multi-centre and longitudinal imaging studies where imaging acquisition varies across a site or in time.",2020-01-29T11:44:32Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10767v1
https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04871,Build-A-FLAIR: Synthetic T2-FLAIR Contrast Generation through Physics Informed Deep Learning,"Purpose: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams include multiple series with varying contrast and redundant information. For instance, T2-FLAIR contrast is based upon tissue T2 decay and the presence of water, also present in T2- and diffusion-weighted contrasts. T2-FLAIR contrast can be hypothetically modeled through deep learning models trained with diffusion- and T2-weighted acquisitions. Methods: Diffusion-, T2-, T2-FLAIR-, and T1-weighted brain images were acquired in 15 individuals. A convolutional neural network was developed to generate a T2-FLAIR image from other contrasts. Two datasets were withheld from training for validation. Results: Inputs with physical relationships to T2-FLAIR contrast most significantly impacted performance. The best model yielded results similar to acquired T2-FLAIR images, with a structural similarity index of 0.909, and reproduced pathology excluded from training. Synthetic images qualitatively exhibited lower noise and increased smoothness compared to acquired images. Conclusion: This suggests that with optimal inputs, deep learning based contrast generation performs well with creating synthetic T2-FLAIR images. Feature engineering on neural network inputs, based upon the physical basis of contrast, impacts the generation of synthetic contrast images. A larger, prospective clinical study is needed.",2019-01-17T19:48:02Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04871
