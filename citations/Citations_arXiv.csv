Beyond the common image structures, parametric imaging can provide the intrinsic tissue property thus could be used in quantitative evaluation. The emerging deep learning approach provides fast and accurate parameter estimation but still encounters the lack of network interpretation and enough training data. Even with a large amount of training data, the mismatch between the training and target data may introduce errors. Here, we propose one way that solely relies on the target scanned data and does not need a pre-defined training database. We provide a proof-of-concept that embeds the physical rule of MRI, the Bloch equation, into the loss of physics-informed neural network (PINN). PINN enables learning the Bloch equation, estimating the T2 parameter, and generating a series of physically synthetic data. Experimental results are conducted on phantom and cardiac imaging to demonstrate its potential in quantitative MRI.",2023-09-21T03:53:33Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11763v1
http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10767v1,Physics-informed brain MRI segmentation,"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is one of the most flexible and powerful medical imaging modalities. This flexibility does however come at a cost; MRI images acquired at different sites and with different parameters exhibit significant differences in contrast and tissue appearance, resulting in downstream issues when quantifying brain anatomy or the presence of pathology. In this work, we propose to combine multiparametric MRI-based static-equation sequence simulations with segmentation convolutional neural networks (CNN), to make these networks robust to variations in acquisition parameters. Results demonstrate that, when given both the image and their associated physics acquisition parameters, CNNs can produce segmentations that exhibit robustness to acquisition variations. We also show that the proposed physics-informed methods can be used to bridge multi-centre and longitudinal imaging studies where imaging acquisition varies across a site or in time.",2020-01-29T11:44:32Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10767v1
http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02592v2,Investigating molecular transport in the human brain from MRI with physics-informed neural networks,"In recent years, a plethora of methods combining deep neural networks and partial differential equations have been developed. A widely known and popular example are physics-informed neural networks. They solve forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations in terms of a neural network training problem. We apply physics-informed neural networks as well as the finite element method to estimate the diffusion coefficient governing the long term, i.e. over days, spread of molecules in the human brain from a novel magnetic resonance imaging technique. Synthetic testcases are created to demonstrate that the standard formulation of the physics-informed neural network faces challenges with noisy measurements in our application. Our numerical results demonstrate that the residual of the partial differential equation after training needs to be small in order to obtain accurate recovery of the diffusion coefficient. To achieve this, we apply several strategies such as tuning the weights and the norms used in the loss function as well as residual based adaptive refinement and exchange of residual training points. We find that the diffusion coefficient estimated with PINNs from magnetic resonance images becomes consistent with results from a finite element based approach when the residuum after training becomes small. The observations presented in this work are an important first step towards solving inverse problems on observations from large cohorts of patients in a semi-automated fashion with physics-informed neural networks.",2022-05-05T12:05:17Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02592v2
http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12549v1,WarpPINN: Cine-MR image registration with physics-informed neural networks,"Heart failure is typically diagnosed with a global function assessment, such as ejection fraction. However, these metrics have low discriminate power, failing to distinguish different types of this disease. Quantifying local deformations in the form of cardiac strain can provide helpful information, but it remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce WarpPINN, a physics-informed neural network to perform image registration to obtain local metrics of the heart deformation. We apply this method to cine magnetic resonance images to estimate the motion during the cardiac cycle. We inform our neural network of near-incompressibility of cardiac tissue by penalizing the jacobian of the deformation field. The loss function has two components: an intensity-based similarity term between the reference and the warped template images, and a regularizer that represents the hyperelastic behavior of the tissue. The architecture of the neural network allows us to easily compute the strain via automatic differentiation to assess cardiac activity. We use Fourier feature mappings to overcome the spectral bias of neural networks, allowing us to capture discontinuities in the strain field. We test our algorithm on a synthetic example and on a cine-MRI benchmark of 15 healthy volunteers. We outperform current methodologies both landmark tracking and strain estimation. We expect that WarpPINN will enable more precise diagnostics of heart failure based on local deformation information.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14211v1,Error Bound Analysis of Physics-Informed Neural Networks-Driven T2 Quantification in Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) are emerging as a promising approach for quantitative parameter estimation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). While existing deep learning methods can provide an accurate quantitative estimation of the T2 parameter, they still require large amounts of training data and lack theoretical support and a recognized gold standard. Thus, given the absence of PINN-based approaches for T2 estimation, we propose embedding the fundamental physics of MRI, the Bloch equation, in the loss of PINN, which is solely based on target scan data and does not require a pre-defined training database. Furthermore, by deriving rigorous upper bounds for both the T2 estimation error and the generalization error of the Bloch equation solution, we establish a theoretical foundation for evaluating the PINN's quantitative accuracy. Even without access to the ground truth or a gold standard, this theory enables us to estimate the error with respect to the real quantitative parameter T2. The accuracy of T2 mapping and the validity of the theoretical analysis are demonstrated on a numerical cardiac model and a water phantom, where our method exhibits excellent quantitative precision in the myocardial T2 range. Clinical applicability is confirmed in 94 acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients, achieving low-error quantitative T2 estimation under the theoretical error bound, highlighting the robustness and potential of PINN.",2025-12-16T09:09:27Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14211v1

This article provides an overview of the recent developments in incorporating physics information into learning-based MRI reconstruction. We consider inverse problems with both linear and non-linear forward models for computational MRI, and review the classical approaches for solving these. We then focus on physics-driven deep learning approaches, covering physics-driven loss functions, plug-and-play methods, generative models, and unrolled networks. We highlight domain-specific challenges such as real- and complex-valued building blocks of neural networks, and translational applications in MRI with linear and non-linear forward models.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07280v2,ERNAS: An Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search for Magnetic Resonance Image Reconstructions,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the noninvasive imaging modalities that can produce high-quality images. However, the scan procedure is relatively slow, which causes patient discomfort and motion artifacts in images. Accelerating MRI hardware is constrained by physical and physiological limitations. A popular alternative approach to accelerated MRI is to undersample the k-space data. While undersampling speeds up the scan procedure, it generates artifacts in the images, and advanced reconstruction algorithms are needed to produce artifact-free images. Recently deep learning has emerged as a promising MRI reconstruction method to address this problem. However, straightforward adoption of the existing deep learning neural network architectures in MRI reconstructions is not usually optimal in terms of efficiency and reconstruction quality. In this work, MRI reconstruction from undersampled data was carried out using an optimized neural network using a novel evolutionary neural architecture search algorithm. Brain and knee MRI datasets show that the proposed algorithm outperforms manually designed neural network-based MR reconstruction models.",2022-06-15T03:42:18Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07280v2
http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07110v1,Physics-informed graph neural networks for flow field estimation in carotid arteries,"Hemodynamic quantities are valuable biomedical risk factors for cardiovascular pathology such as atherosclerosis. Non-invasive, in-vivo measurement of these quantities can only be performed using a select number of modalities that are not widely available, such as 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this work, we create a surrogate model for hemodynamic flow field estimation, powered by machine learning. We train graph neural networks that include priors about the underlying symmetries and physics, limiting the amount of data required for training. This allows us to train the model using moderately-sized, in-vivo 4D flow MRI datasets, instead of large in-silico datasets obtained by computational fluid dynamics (CFD), as is the current standard. We create an efficient, equivariant neural network by combining the popular PointNet++ architecture with group-steerable layers. To incorporate the physics-informed priors, we derive an efficient discretisation scheme for the involved differential operators. We perform extensive experiments in carotid arteries and show that our model can accurately estimate low-noise hemodynamic flow fields in the carotid artery. Moreover, we show how the learned relation between geometry and hemodynamic quantities transfers to 3D vascular models obtained using a different imaging modality than the training data. This shows that physics-informed graph neural networks can be trained using 4D flow MRI data to estimate blood flow in unseen carotid artery geometries.",2024-08-13T13:09:28Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07110v1

http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11790v1,Physics-Informed Deep Unrolled Network for Portable MR Image Reconstruction,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard imaging modality for numerous diagnostic tasks, yet its usefulness is tempered due to its high cost and infrastructural requirements. Low-cost very-low-field portable scanners offer new opportunities, while enabling imaging outside conventional MRI suites. However, achieving diagnostic-quality images in clinically acceptable scan times remains challenging with these systems. Therefore methods for improving the image quality while reducing the scan duration are highly desirable. Here, we investigate a physics-informed 3D deep unrolled network for the reconstruction of portable MR acquisitions. Our approach includes a novel network architecture that utilizes momentum-based acceleration and leverages complex conjugate symmetry of k-space for improved reconstruction performance. Comprehensive evaluations on emulated datasets as well as 47mT portable MRI acquisitions demonstrate the improved reconstruction quality of the proposed method compared to existing methods.",2025-09-15T11:20:13Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11790v1
http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05447v1,Segmentation and Generation of Magnetic Resonance Images by Deep Neural Networks,"Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs) are extremely used in the medical field to detect and better understand diseases. In order to fasten automatic processing of scans and enhance medical research, this project focuses on automatically segmenting targeted parts of MRIs and generating new MRI datasets from random noise. More specifically, a Deep Neural Network architecture called U-net is used to segment bones and cartilages of Knee MRIs, and several Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are compared and tuned to create new realistic and high quality brain MRIs that can be used as training set for more advanced models. Three main architectures are described: Deep Convolution GAN (DCGAN), Super Resolution Residual GAN (SRResGAN) and Progressive GAN (ProGAN), and five loss functions are tested: the Original loss, LSGAN, WGAN, WGAN_GP and DRAGAN. Moreover, a quantitative benchmark is carried out thanks to evaluation measures using Principal Component Analysis. The results show that U-net can achieve state-of-the-art performance in segmenting bones and cartilages in Knee MRIs (Accuracy of more than 99.5%). Moreover, the three GAN architectures can successfully generate realistic brain MRIs even if some models have difficulties to converge. The main insights to stabilize the networks are using one-sided smoothing labels, regularization with gradient penalty in the loss function (like in WGAN_GP or DRAGAN), adding a minibatch similarity layer in the Discriminator and a long training time.",2020-01-10T16:28:25Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05447v1
http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12844v3,Physics-informed neural networks for myocardial perfusion MRI quantification,"Tracer-kinetic models allow for the quantification of kinetic parameters such as blood flow from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) images. Fitting the observed data with multi-compartment exchange models is desirable, as they are physiologically plausible and resolve directly for blood flow and microvascular function. However, the reliability of model fitting is limited by the low signal-to-noise ratio, temporal resolution, and acquisition length. This may result in inaccurate parameter estimates.   This study introduces physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) as a means to perform myocardial perfusion MR quantification, which provides a versatile scheme for the inference of kinetic parameters. These neural networks can be trained to fit the observed perfusion MR data while respecting the underlying physical conservation laws described by a multi-compartment exchange model. Here, we provide a framework for the implementation of PINNs in myocardial perfusion MR.   The approach is validated both in silico and in vivo. In the in silico study, an overall reduction in mean-squared error with the ground-truth parameters was observed compared to a standard non-linear least squares fitting approach. The in vivo study demonstrates that the method produces parameter values comparable to those previously found in literature, as well as providing parameter maps which match the clinical diagnosis of patients.",2020-11-25T16:02:52Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12844v3
http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08872v1,WarpPINN-fibers: improved cardiac strain estimation from cine-MR with physics-informed neural networks,"The contractile motion of the heart is strongly determined by the distribution of the fibers that constitute cardiac tissue. Strain analysis informed with the orientation of fibers allows to describe several pathologies that are typically associated with impaired mechanics of the myocardium, such as cardiovascular disease. Several methods have been developed to estimate strain-derived metrics from traditional imaging techniques. However, the physical models underlying these methods do not include fiber mechanics, restricting their capacity to accurately explain cardiac function. In this work, we introduce WarpPINN-fibers, a physics-informed neural network framework to accurately obtain cardiac motion and strains enhanced by fiber information. We train our neural network to satisfy a hyper-elastic model and promote fiber contraction with the goal to predict the deformation field of the heart from cine magnetic resonance images. For this purpose, we build a loss function composed of three terms: a data-similarity loss between the reference and the warped template images, a regularizer enforcing near-incompressibility of cardiac tissue and a fiber-stretch penalization that controls strain in the direction of synthetically produced fibers. We show that our neural network improves the former WarpPINN model and effectively controls fiber stretch in a synthetic phantom experiment. Then, we demonstrate that WarpPINN-fibers outperforms alternative methodologies in landmark-tracking and strain curve prediction for a cine-MRI benchmark with a cohort of 15 healthy volunteers. We expect that our method will enable a more precise quantification of cardiac strains through accurate deformation fields that are consistent with fiber physiology, without requiring imaging techniques more sophisticated than MRI.",2025-09-10T14:53:31Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08872v1
http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12570v1,Generalizable synthetic MRI with physics-informed convolutional networks,"In this study, we develop a physics-informed deep learning-based method to synthesize multiple brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrasts from a single five-minute acquisition and investigate its ability to generalize to arbitrary contrasts to accelerate neuroimaging protocols. A dataset of fifty-five subjects acquired with a standard MRI protocol and a five-minute transient-state sequence was used to develop a physics-informed deep learning-based method. The model, based on a generative adversarial network, maps data acquired from the five-minute scan to ""effective"" quantitative parameter maps, here named q*-maps, by using its generated PD, T1, and T2 values in a signal model to synthesize four standard contrasts (proton density-weighted, T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery), from which losses are computed. The q*-maps are compared to literature values and the synthetic contrasts are compared to an end-to-end deep learning-based method proposed by literature. The generalizability of the proposed method is investigated for five volunteers by synthesizing three non-standard contrasts unseen during training and comparing these to respective ground truth acquisitions via contrast-to-noise ratio and quantitative assessment. The physics-informed method was able to match the high-quality synthMRI of the end-to-end method for the four standard contrasts, with mean \pm standard deviation structural similarity metrics above 0.75 \pm 0.08 and peak signal-to-noise ratios above 22.4 \pm 1.9 and 22.6 \pm 2.1. Additionally, the physics-informed method provided retrospective contrast adjustment, with visually similar signal contrast and comparable contrast-to-noise ratios to the ground truth acquisitions for three sequences unused for model training, demonstrating its generalizability and potential application to accelerate neuroimaging protocols.",2023-05-21T21:16:20Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12570v1
http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02480v2,Learning Optimal K-space Acquisition and Reconstruction using Physics-Informed Neural Networks,"The inherent slow imaging speed of Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) has spurred the development of various acceleration methods, typically through heuristically undersampling the MRI measurement domain known as k-space. Recently, deep neural networks have been applied to reconstruct undersampled k-space data and have shown improved reconstruction performance. While most of these methods focus on designing novel reconstruction networks or new training strategies for a given undersampling pattern, e.g., Cartesian undersampling or Non-Cartesian sampling, to date, there is limited research aiming to learn and optimize k-space sampling strategies using deep neural networks. This work proposes a novel optimization framework to learn k-space sampling trajectories by considering it as an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) problem that can be solved using neural ODE. In particular, the sampling of k-space data is framed as a dynamic system, in which neural ODE is formulated to approximate the system with additional constraints on MRI physics. In addition, we have also demonstrated that trajectory optimization and image reconstruction can be learned collaboratively for improved imaging efficiency and reconstruction performance. Experiments were conducted on different in-vivo datasets (e.g., brain and knee images) acquired with different sequences. Initial results have shown that our proposed method can generate better image quality in accelerated MRI than conventional undersampling schemes in Cartesian and Non-Cartesian acquisitions.",2022-04-05T20:28:42Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02480v2

The cascaded network architecture for MRI reconstruction has been widely used, while it suffers from the ""vanishing gradient"" problem when the network becomes deep. In addition, homogeneous architecture degrades the representation capacity of the network. In this work, we present an enhanced MRI reconstruction network using a residual in residual basic block. For each cell in the basic block, we use the differentiable neural architecture search (NAS) technique to automatically choose the optimal operation among eight variants of the dense block.

However, these approaches depend on fully-sampled scans as ground truth data which is either costly or not possible to acquire in many clinical medical imaging applications; hence, reducing dependence on data is desirable. In this work, we propose modeling the proximal operators of unrolled neural networks with scale-equivariant convolutional neural networks in order to improve the data-efficiency and robustness to drifts in scale of the images that might stem from the variability of patient anatomies or change in field-of-view across different MRI scanners. Our approach demonstrates strong improvements over the state-of-the-art unrolled neural networks under the same memory constraints both with and without data augmentations on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scaled images without significantly increasing the train or inference time.",2022-04-21T23:29:52Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10436v1

Previous methods employ convolutional networks to learn the image prior as the regularization term. In quantitative MRI, the physical model of nuclear magnetic resonance relaxometry is known, providing additional prior knowledge for image reconstruction. However, traditional reconstruction networks are limited to learning the spatial domain prior knowledge, ignoring the relaxometry prior. Therefore, we propose a relaxometry-guided quantitative MRI reconstruction framework to learn the spatial prior from data and the relaxometry prior from MRI physics. Additionally, we also evaluated the performance of two popular reconstruction backbones, namely, recurrent variational networks (RVN) and variational networks (VN) with U- Net.

However, its application to imaging bolus movement through the esophagus has only been demonstrated in few feasibility studies and is relatively unexplored. In this work, we present a computational framework called mechanics-informed MRI (MRI-MECH) that enhances that capability thereby increasing the applicability of dynamic MRI for diagnosing esophageal disorders. Pineapple juice was used as the swallowed contrast material for the dynamic MRI and the MRI image sequence was used as input to the MRI-MECH. The MRI-MECH modeled the esophagus as a flexible one-dimensional tube and the elastic tube walls followed a linear tube law. Flow through the esophagus was then governed by one-dimensional mass and momentum conservation equations. These equations were solved using a physics-informed neural network (PINN). The PINN minimized the difference between the measurements from the MRI and model predictions ensuring that the physics of the fluid flow problem was always followed. MRI-MECH calculated the fluid velocity and pressure during esophageal transit and estimated the mechanical health of the esophagus by calculating wall stiffness and active relaxation. Additionally, MRI-MECH predicted missing information about the lower esophageal sphincter during the emptying process, demonstrating its applicability to scenarios with missing data or poor image resolution. In addition to potentially improving clinical decisions based on quantitative estimates of the mechanical health of the esophagus, MRI-MECH can also be enhanced for application to other medical imaging modalities to enhance their functionality as well.",2022-09-15T17:34:23Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07492v1

It expands the Deep Image Prior approach with a multidomain, sparsity-enforcing loss function to achieve higher image quality at a faster convergence speed than previously reported methods. Methods: Two-dimensional MRI data from the FastMRI dataset with Cartesian undersampling in phase-encoding direction were reconstructed for different acceleration rates for single coil and multicoil data. Results: The performance of our architecture was compared to state-of-the-art Compressed Sensing methods and ConvDecoder, another untrained Neural Network for two-dimensional MRI reconstruction. SCAMPI outperforms these by better reducing undersampling artifacts and yielding lower error metrics in multicoil imaging. In comparison to ConvDecoder, the U-Net architecture combined with an elaborated loss-function allows for much faster convergence at higher image quality. SCAMPI can reconstruct multicoil data without explicit knowledge of coil sensitivity profiles. Moreover, it is a novel tool for reconstructing undersampled single coil k-space data. Conclusion: Our approach avoids overfitting to dataset features, that can occur in Neural Networks trained on databases, because the network parameters are tuned only on the reconstruction data.

To reduce the acquisition time, fast MRI reconstruction aims to restore high-quality images from the undersampled k-space. Existing methods typically train deep learning models to map the undersampled data to artifact-free MRI images. However, these studies often overlook the unique properties of k-space and directly apply general networks designed for image processing to k-space recovery, leaving the precise learning of k-space largely underexplored. In this work, we propose a continuous k-space recovery network from a new perspective of implicit neural representation with image domain guidance, which boosts the performance of MRI reconstruction. Specifically, (1) an implicit neural representation based encoder-decoder structure is customized to continuously query unsampled k-values. (2) an image guidance module is designed to mine the semantic information from the low-quality MRI images to further guide the k-space recovery.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19759v1,PINNing Cerebral Blood Flow: Analysis of Perfusion MRI in Infants using Physics-Informed Neural Networks,"Arterial spin labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables cerebral perfusion measurement, which is crucial in detecting and managing neurological issues in infants born prematurely or after perinatal complications. However, cerebral blood flow (CBF) estimation in infants using ASL remains challenging due to the complex interplay of network physiology, involving dynamic interactions between cardiac output and cerebral perfusion, as well as issues with parameter uncertainty and data noise. We propose a new spatial uncertainty-based physics-informed neural network (PINN), SUPINN, to estimate CBF and other parameters from infant ASL data. SUPINN employs a multi-branch architecture to concurrently estimate regional and global model parameters across multiple voxels. It computes regional spatial uncertainties to weigh the signal. SUPINN can reliably estimate CBF (relative error $-0.3 \pm 71.7$), bolus arrival time (AT) ($30.5 \pm 257.8$), and blood longitudinal relaxation time ($T_{1b}$) ($-4.4 \pm 28.9$), surpassing parameter estimates performed using least squares or standard PINNs. Furthermore, SUPINN produces physiologically plausible spatially smooth CBF and AT maps. Our study demonstrates the successful modification of PINNs for accurate multi-parameter perfusion estimation from noisy and limited ASL data in infants.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12892v1,IMJENSE: Scan-specific Implicit Representation for Joint Coil Sensitivity and Image Estimation in Parallel MRI,"Parallel imaging is a commonly used technique to accelerate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data acquisition. Mathematically, parallel MRI reconstruction can be formulated as an inverse problem relating the sparsely sampled k-space measurements to the desired MRI image. Despite the success of many existing reconstruction algorithms, it remains a challenge to reliably reconstruct a high-quality image from highly reduced k-space measurements. Recently, implicit neural representation has emerged as a powerful paradigm to exploit the internal information and the physics of partially acquired data to generate the desired object. In this study, we introduced IMJENSE, a scan-specific implicit neural representation-based method for improving parallel MRI reconstruction. Specifically, the underlying MRI image and coil sensitivities were modeled as continuous functions of spatial coordinates, parameterized by neural networks and polynomials, respectively. The weights in the networks and coefficients in the polynomials were simultaneously learned directly from sparsely acquired k-space measurements, without fully sampled ground truth data for training. Benefiting from the powerful continuous representation and joint estimation of the MRI image and coil sensitivities, IMJENSE outperforms conventional image or k-space domain reconstruction algorithms. With extremely limited calibration data, IMJENSE is more stable than supervised calibrationless and calibration-based deep-learning methods. Results show that IMJENSE robustly reconstructs the images acquired at 5$\mathbf{\times}$ and 6$\mathbf{\times}$ accelerations with only 4 or 8 calibration lines in 2D Cartesian acquisitions, corresponding to 22.0% and 19.5% undersampling rates. The high-quality results and scanning specificity make the proposed method hold the potential for further accelerating the data acquisition of parallel MRI.",2023-11-21T07:24:11Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12892v1

The segmentation is a pre-requisite for estimating the average displacements in these regions, which have recently been proposed as biomarkers in the diagnosis of Chiari Malformation type I (CMI). In numerical experiments, the segmentations of both methods were similar to manual segmentations provided by trained experts. It was found that, overall, the neural-network-based method alone produced more accurate segmentations than the atlas-based method did alone, but that a combination of the two methods -- in which the atlas-based method is used for the segmentation of the brain stem and the neural-network is used for the segmentation of the cerebellum -- may be the most successful.",2021-09-29T00:42:43Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14116v1

However, obtaining high-quality 4D-MRI suffers from long acquisition and reconstruction times.   Purpose: To develop a deep learning architecture to quickly acquire and reconstruct high-quality 4D-MRI, enabling accurate motion quantification for MRI-guided radiotherapy.   Methods: A small convolutional neural network called MODEST is proposed to reconstruct 4D-MRI by performing a spatial and temporal decomposition, omitting the need for 4D convolutions to use all the spatio-temporal information present in 4D-MRI. This network is trained on undersampled 4D-MRI after respiratory binning to reconstruct high-quality 4D-MRI obtained by compressed sensing reconstruction. The network is trained, validated, and tested on 4D-MRI of 28 lung cancer patients acquired with a T1-weighted golden-angle radial stack-of-stars sequence. The 4D-MRI of 18, 5, and 5 patients were used for training, validation, and testing. Network performances are evaluated on image quality measured by the structural similarity index (SSIM) and motion consistency by comparing the position of the lung-liver interface on undersampled 4D-MRI before and after respiratory binning. The network is compared to conventional architectures such as a U-Net, which has 30 times more trainable parameters.   Results: MODEST can reconstruct high-quality 4D-MRI with higher image quality than a U-Net, despite a thirty-fold reduction in trainable parameters. High-quality 4D-MRI can be obtained using MODEST in approximately 2.5 minutes, including acquisition, processing, and reconstruction.   Conclusion: High-quality accelerated 4D-MRI can be obtained using MODEST, which is particularly interesting for MRI-guided radiotherapy.",2022-11-10T16:34:24Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05678v2
http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09559v2,The R2D2 Deep Neural Network Series for Scalable Non-Cartesian Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"We introduce the R2D2 Deep Neural Network (DNN) series paradigm for fast and scalable image reconstruction from highly-accelerated non-Cartesian k-space acquisitions in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). While unrolled DNN architectures provide a robust image formation approach via data-consistency layers, embedding non-uniform fast Fourier transform operators in a DNN can become impractical to train at large scale, e.g in 2D MRI with a large number of coils, or for higher-dimensional imaging. Plug-and-play approaches that alternate a learned denoiser blind to the measurement setting with a data-consistency step are not affected by this limitation but their highly iterative nature implies slow reconstruction. To address this scalability challenge, we leverage the R2D2 paradigm that was recently introduced to enable ultra-fast reconstruction for large-scale Fourier imaging in radio astronomy. R2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images iteratively estimated as outputs of DNN modules taking the previous iteration's data residual as input. The method can be interpreted as a learned version of the Matching Pursuit algorithm. A series of R2D2 DNN modules were sequentially trained in a supervised manner on the fastMRI dataset and validated for 2D multi-coil MRI in simulation and on real data, targeting highly under-sampled radial k-space sampling. Results suggest that a series with only few DNNs achieves superior reconstruction quality over its unrolled incarnation R2D2-Net (whose training is also much less scalable), and over the state-of-the-art diffusion-based ""Decomposed Diffusion Sampler"" approach (also characterised by a slower reconstruction process).",2025-03-12T17:24:47Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09559v2

However, even with the graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration, the heavy computational load remains a major challenge, especially in large-scale, high-accuracy simulation scenarios. This work aims to develop a deep learning-based simulator to accelerate Bloch simulation. Approach: The simulator model, called Simu-Net, is based on an end-to-end convolutional neural network and is trained with synthetic data generated by traditional Bloch simulation. It uses dynamic convolution to fuse spatial and physical information with different dimensions and introduces position encoding templates to achieve position-specific labeling and overcome the receptive field limitation of the convolutional network. Main Results: Compared with mainstream GPU-based MRI simulation software, Simu-Net successfully accelerates simulations by hundreds of times in both traditional and advanced MRI pulse sequences. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed framework were verified qualitatively and quantitatively. Besides, the trained Simu-Net was applied to generate sufficient customized training samples for deep learning-based T2 mapping and comparable results to conventional methods were obtained in the human brain. Significance: As a proof-of-concept work, Simu-Net shows the potential to apply deep learning for rapidly approximating the forward physical process of MRI and may increase the efficiency of Bloch simulation for optimization of MRI pulse sequences and deep learning-based methods.",2022-10-19T08:46:03Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10379v3

It can be greatly augmented by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that offers excellent soft-tissue contrast and high-resolution brain anatomy. Nevertheless, registration of multi-modal images remains challenging, chiefly due to the entirely different image contrast rendered by these modalities. Previously reported registration algorithms mostly relied on manual user-dependent brain segmentation, which compromised data interpretation and accurate quantification. Here we propose a fully automated registration method for MSOT-MRI multimodal imaging empowered by deep learning. The automated workflow includes neural network-based image segmentation to generate suitable masks, which are subsequently registered using an additional neural network. Performance of the algorithm is showcased with datasets acquired by cross-sectional MSOT and high-field MRI preclinical scanners.

In the present work, we study Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), and their Physics-Informed extensions (PI-DeepONets) in predicting vascular flow simulations in the context of a 3D Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) idealized model. PINN is a technique that combines deep neural networks with the fundamental principles of physics, incorporating the physics laws, which are given as partial differential equations, directly into loss functions used during the training process. On the other hand, DeepONet is designed to learn nonlinear operators from data and is particularly useful in studying parametric partial differential equations (PDEs), e.g., families of PDEs with different source terms, boundary conditions, or initial conditions. Here, we adapt the approaches to address the particular use case of AAA by integrating the 3D Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) as the physical laws governing fluid dynamics. In addition, we follow best practices to enhance the capabilities of the models by effectively capturing the underlying physics of the problem under study. The advantages and limitations of each approach are highlighted through a series of relevant application cases. We validate our results by comparing them with CFD simulations for benchmark datasets, demonstrating good agreements and emphasizing those cases where improvements in computational efficiency are observed.",2025-03-19T22:38:52Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17402v1

However, existing deep learning-based image reconstruction methods typically apply weight-sharing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to k-space data without taking into consideration the k-space data's spatial frequency properties, leading to ineffective learning of the image reconstruction models. Moreover, complementary information of spatially adjacent slices is often ignored in existing deep learning methods. To overcome such limitations, we develop a deep learning algorithm, referred to as adaptive convolutional neural networks for k-space data interpolation (ACNN-k-Space), which adopts a residual Encoder-Decoder network architecture to interpolate the undersampled k-space data by integrating spatially contiguous slices as multi-channel input, along with k-space data from multiple coils if available. The network is enhanced by self-attention layers to adaptively focus on k-space data at different spatial frequencies and channels. We have evaluated our method on two public datasets and compared it with state-of-the-art existing methods. Ablation studies and experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively reconstructs images from undersampled k-space data and achieves significantly better image reconstruction performance than current state-of-the-art techniques.",2020-06-02T04:29:33Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01385v2

In this work, we present a constructive approach for designing weakly-convex regularization functions for MR image denoising. We show that our technique performs on par with state-of-the-art denoisers for diffusion-weighted MR image denoising. Our technique can be applied to design weakly-convex convolutional neural networks with prototype activation functions that impart interpretability and are provably convergent.

The diagnosis and treatment of gliomas -- one of the most commonly seen brain tumors with low survival rate -- rely heavily on the computer assisted segmentation process undertaken on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Although the encoder-decoder shaped deep learning networks have been the de facto standard style for semantic segmentation tasks in medical imaging analysis, enormous effort is still required to be spent on designing the detailed architecture of the down-sampling and up-sampling blocks. In this work, we propose a neural architecture search (NAS) based solution to brain tumor segmentation tasks on multimodal volumetric MRI scans. Three sets of candidate operations are composed respectively for three kinds of basic building blocks in which each operation is assigned with a specific probabilistic parameter to be learned. Through alternately updating the weights of operations and the other parameters in the network, the searching mechanism ends up with two optimal structures for the upward and downward blocks. Moreover, the developed solution also integrates normalization and patching strategies tailored for brain MRI processing. Extensive comparative experiments on the BraTS 2019 dataset demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only could relieve the pressure of fabricating block architectures but also possesses competitive feasibility and scalability.",2020-05-13T14:32:00Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06338v2
http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01800v1,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) Powered Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging -- Mini Review, Comparison and Perspectives","Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a vital component of medical imaging. When compared to other image modalities, it has advantages such as the absence of radiation, superior soft tissue contrast, and complementary multiple sequence information. However, one drawback of MRI is its comparatively slow scanning and reconstruction compared to other image modalities, limiting its usage in some clinical applications when imaging time is critical. Traditional compressive sensing based MRI (CS-MRI) reconstruction can speed up MRI acquisition, but suffers from a long iterative process and noise-induced artefacts. Recently, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been used in sparse MRI reconstruction models to recreate relatively high-quality images from heavily undersampled k-space data, allowing for much faster MRI scanning. However, there are still some hurdles to tackle. For example, directly training DNNs based on L1/L2 distance to the target fully sampled images could result in blurry reconstruction because L1/L2 loss can only enforce overall image or patch similarity and does not take into account local information such as anatomical sharpness. It is also hard to preserve fine image details while maintaining a natural appearance. More recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) based methods are proposed to solve fast MRI with enhanced image perceptual quality. The encoder obtains a latent space for the undersampling image, and the image is reconstructed by the decoder using the GAN loss. In this chapter, we review the GAN powered fast MRI methods with a comparative study on various anatomical datasets to demonstrate the generalisability and robustness of this kind of fast MRI while providing future perspectives.",2021-05-04T23:59:00Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01800v1

The growing popularity of image enhancement, generation, and recovery models instigated the development of many methods to assess their performance. However, most IQA solutions are designed to predict image quality in the general domain, with the applicability to specific areas, such as medical imaging, remaining questionable. Moreover, the selection of these IQA metrics for a specific task typically involves intentionally induced distortions, such as manually added noise or artificial blurring; yet, the chosen metrics are then used to judge the output of real-life computer vision models. In this work, we aspire to fill these gaps by carrying out the most extensive IQA evaluation study for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to date (14,700 subjective scores). We use outputs of neural network models trained to solve problems relevant to MRI, including image reconstruction in the scan acceleration, motion correction, and denoising. Our emphasis is on reflecting the radiologist's perception of the reconstructed images, gauging the most diagnostically influential criteria for the quality of MRI scans: signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, and the presence of artifacts. Seven trained radiologists assess these distorted images, with their verdicts then correlated with 35 different image quality metrics (full-reference, no-reference, and distribution-based metrics considered).

http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00143v1,MRDust: Wireless Implant Data Uplink & Localization via Magnetic Resonance Image Modulation,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exhibits rich and clinically useful endogenous contrast mechanisms, which can differentiate soft tissues and are sensitive to flow, diffusion, magnetic susceptibility, blood oxygenation level, and more. However, MRI sensitivity is ultimately constrained by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) physics, and its spatiotemporal resolution is limited by SNR and spatial encoding. On the other hand, miniaturized implantable sensors offer highly localized physiological information, yet communication and localization can be challenging when multiple implants are present. This paper introduces the MRDust, an active ``contrast agent"" that integrates active sensor implants with MRI, enabling the direct encoding of highly localized physiological data into MR images to augment the anatomical images. MRDust employs a micrometer-scale on-chip coil to actively modulate the local magnetic field, enabling MR signal amplitude and phase modulation for digital data transmission. Since MRI inherently captures the anatomical tissue structure, this method has the potential to enable simultaneous data communication, localization, and image registration with multiple implants. This paper presents the underlying physical principles, design tradeoffs, and design methodology for this approach. To validate the concept, a 900 $\times$ 990 $μ$m$^2$ chip was designed using TSMC 28 nm technology, with an on-chip coil measuring 630 $μ$m in diameter. The chip was tested with custom hardware in an MR750W GE3T MRI scanner.

As compared to computed tomography (CT), MRI, however, requires a long scan time, which inevitably induces motion artifacts and causes patients' discomfort. Thus, there has been a strong clinical motivation to develop techniques to reduce both the scan time and motion artifacts. Given its successful applications in other medical imaging tasks such as MRI super-resolution and CT metal artifact reduction, deep learning is a promising approach for cardiac MRI motion artifact reduction. In this paper, we propose a recurrent neural network to simultaneously extract both spatial and temporal features from under-sampled, motion-blurred cine cardiac images for improved image quality. The experimental results demonstrate substantially improved image quality on two clinical test datasets. Also, our method enables data-driven frame interpolation at an enhanced temporal resolution. Compared with existing methods, our deep learning approach gives a superior performance in terms of structural similarity (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).",2020-06-23T01:55:57Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12700v1

These measurements are dense but have a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The measurements can be de-noised by imposing physical constraints on the flow, which are encapsulated in governing equations for mass and momentum. Previous studies have required the shape of the boundary (for example, a blood vessel) to be known a priori. This, however, requires a set of additional measurements, which can be expensive to obtain. In this paper, we present a physics-informed neural network that instead uses the noisy MRV data alone to simultaneously infer the most likely boundary shape and de-noised velocity field. We achieve this by training an auxiliary neural network that takes the value 1.0 within the inferred domain of the governing PDE and 0.0 outside. This network is used to weight the PDE residual term in the loss function accordingly and implicitly learns the geometry of the system. We test our algorithm by assimilating both synthetic and real MRV measurements for flows that can be well modeled by the Poisson and Stokes equations. We find that we are able to reconstruct very noisy (SNR = 2.5) MRV signals and recover the ground truth with low reconstruction errors of 3.7 - 7.5%. The simplicity and flexibility of our physics-informed neural network approach can readily scale to assimilating MRV data with complex 3D geometries, time-varying 4D data, or unknown parameters in the physical model.",2021-07-16T12:56:09Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07863v1

Often times, radiologists either ""see through"" the artifacts with reduced diagnostic confidence, or the MR scans are rejected and patients are asked to be recalled and re-scanned. Presently, there are many published approaches that focus on MRI artifact detection and correction. However, the key question of the bias exhibited by these algorithms on motion corrupted MRI images is still unanswered. In this paper, we seek to quantify the bias in terms of the impact that different levels of motion artifacts have on the performance of neural networks engaged in a lesion segmentation task. Additionally, we explore the effect of a different learning strategy, curriculum learning, on the segmentation performance. Our results suggest that a network trained using curriculum learning is effective at compensating for different levels of motion artifacts, and improved the segmentation performance by ~9%-15% (p < 0.05) when compared against a conventional shuffled learning strategy on the same motion data. Within each motion category, it either improved or maintained the dice score. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to quantitatively assess the segmentation bias on various levels of motion artifacts present in a brain MRI image.",2020-10-12T21:06:40Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06027v1

Effective denoising is critical for enhancing image quality while preserving anatomical structures. However traditional denoising methods which typically assume uniform noise distributions struggle to handle the non-uniform noise commonly present in MRI images. In this paper we introduce a novel approach leveraging a sparse mixture-of-experts framework for MRI image denoising. Each expert is a specialized denoising convolutional neural network fine-tuned to target specific noise characteristics associated with different image regions. Our method demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art denoising techniques on both synthetic and real-world MRI datasets.

In this study, we adopted INR to parallel MRI reconstruction. The MRI image was modeled as a continuous function of spatial coordinates. This function was parameterized by a neural network and learned directly from the measured k-space itself without additional fully sampled high-quality training data. Benefitting from the powerful continuous representations provided by INR, the proposed method outperforms existing methods by suppressing the aliasing artifacts and noise, especially at higher acceleration rates and smaller sizes of the auto-calibration signals. The high-quality results and scanning specificity make the proposed method hold the potential for further accelerating the data acquisition of parallel MRI.",2022-10-19T10:16:03Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10439v1

Additionally, current motion simulations often only assume simplified motion patterns. Our simulations, on the other hand, include real recorded subject motion and realistic effects of motion-induced magnetic field inhomogeneity changes. We demonstrate the use of such simulated data by training a convolutional neural network to detect the presence of motion in affected k-space lines.

Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency.

In this paper, we propose a reconstruction approach based on representing the beating heart with an implicit neural network and fitting the network so that the representation of the heart is consistent with the measurements. The network in the form of a multi-layer perceptron with Fourier-feature inputs acts as an effective signal prior and enables adjusting the regularization strength in both the spatial and temporal dimensions of the signal. We study the proposed approach for 2D free-breathing cardiac real-time MRI in different operating regimes, i.e., for different image resolutions, slice thicknesses, and acquisition lengths. Our method achieves reconstruction quality on par with or slightly better than state-of-the-art untrained convolutional neural networks and superior image quality compared to a recent method that fits an implicit representation directly to Fourier-domain measurements.

Specifically, we compute a multivariate normal distribution based upon Gaussian processes using a publicly available library of T1-weighted images of healthy brains. We combine this library with physics-informed envelope functions to only retain meaningful correlations in k-space. This covariance function is then used to select a series of ring-shaped subsampling paths using Bayesian optimization such that they optimally explore space while remaining practically realizable in commercial MRI systems. Combining optimized subsampling paths found for a range of images, we compute a generalized sampling path that, when used for novel images, produces superlative structural similarity and error in comparison to previously reported reconstruction processes (i.e. 96.3% structural similarity and <0.003 normalized mean squared error from sampling only 12.5% of the k-space data).

Even if we annotate enough data, MRI images display considerable variability due to factors such as differences in patients, MRI scanners, and imaging protocols. This variability necessitates retraining neural networks for each specific application domain, which, in turn, requires manual annotation by expert radiologists for all new domains. To relax the need for persistent data annotation, we develop a method for unsupervised federated domain adaptation using multiple annotated source domains. Our approach enables the transfer of knowledge from several annotated source domains to adapt a model for effective use in an unannotated target domain. Initially, we ensure that the target domain data shares similar representations with each source domain in a latent embedding space, modeled as the output of a deep encoder, by minimizing the pair-wise distances of the distributions for the target domain and the source domains. We then employ an ensemble approach to leverage the knowledge obtained from all domains.

Explicit incorporation of these symmetry priors in the reconstruction model can significantly improve image quality, especially under aggressive undersampling scenarios. Recently, Equivariant convolutional neural network (ECNN) has shown great promise in exploiting spatial symmetry priors.

However, these methods require complex network architectures to extract speckle image features, which does not guarantee solution accuracy This paper introduces PINN-DIC, a novel DIC method based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Unlike traditional approaches, PINN-DIC uses a simple fully connected neural network that takes the coordinate domain as input and outputs the displacement field. By integrating the DIC governing equation into the loss function, PINN-DIC directly extracts the displacement field from reference and deformed speckle images through iterative optimization. Evaluations on simulated and real experiments demonstrate that PINN-DIC maintains the accuracy of deep learning-based DIC in non-uniform fields while offering three distinct advantages: 1) enhanced precision with a simpler network by directly fitting the displacement field from coordinates, 2) effective handling of irregular boundary displacement fields with minimal parameter adjustments, and 3) easy integration with other neural network-based mechanical analysis methods for comprehensive DIC result analysis.",2024-09-02T05:53:00Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00956v1

Here, we tested a method for generating microscopic histological images from MRI scans of the human corpus callosum using conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) architecture. To our knowledge, this is the first multimodal translation of the brain MRI to histological volumetric representation of the same sample. The technique was assessed by training paired image translation models taking sets of images from MRI scans and microscopy. The use of cGAN for this purpose is challenging because microscopy images are large in size and typically have low sample availability. The current work demonstrates that the framework reliably synthesizes histology images from MRI scans of corpus callosum, emphasizing the network's ability to train on high resolution histologies paired with relatively lower-resolution MRI scans. With the ultimate goal of avoiding biopsies, the proposed tool can be used for educational purposes.",2023-10-16T13:58:53Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10414v3

Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more costly than the above approaches, the recent developments in this area now allow the recording of real-time MRI videos of the articulators with an acceptable resolution. Here, we experiment with the reconstruction of the speech signal from a real-time MRI recording using deep neural networks. Instead of estimating speech directly, our networks are trained to output a spectral vector, from which we reconstruct the speech signal using the WaveGlow neural vocoder. We compare the performance of three deep neural architectures for the estimation task, combining convolutional (CNN) and recurrence-based (LSTM) neural layers. Besides the mean absolute error (MAE) of our networks, we also evaluate our models by comparing the speech signals obtained using several objective speech quality metrics like the mean cepstral distortion (MCD), Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI), Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ) and Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR).

http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13839v1,Fill the K-Space and Refine the Image: Prompting for Dynamic and Multi-Contrast MRI Reconstruction,"The key to dynamic or multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction lies in exploring inter-frame or inter-contrast information. Currently, the unrolled model, an approach combining iterative MRI reconstruction steps with learnable neural network layers, stands as the best-performing method for MRI reconstruction. However, there are two main limitations to overcome: firstly, the unrolled model structure and GPU memory constraints restrict the capacity of each denoising block in the network, impeding the effective extraction of detailed features for reconstruction; secondly, the existing model lacks the flexibility to adapt to variations in the input, such as different contrasts, resolutions or views, necessitating the training of separate models for each input type, which is inefficient and may lead to insufficient reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a two-stage MRI reconstruction pipeline to address these limitations. The first stage involves filling the missing k-space data, which we approach as a physics-based reconstruction problem. We first propose a simple yet efficient baseline model, which utilizes adjacent frames/contrasts and channel attention to capture the inherent inter-frame/-contrast correlation. Then, we extend the baseline model to a prompt-based learning approach, PromptMR, for all-in-one MRI reconstruction from different views, contrasts, adjacent types, and acceleration factors. The second stage is to refine the reconstruction from the first stage, which we treat as a general video restoration problem to further fuse features from neighboring frames/contrasts in the image domain. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art accelerated MRI reconstruction methods.",2023-09-25T02:51:00Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13839v1

We first estimate the motion field (INF) between any two consecutive t-MRI frames by a bi-directional generative diffeomorphic registration neural network. Using this result, we then estimate the Lagrangian motion field between the reference frame and any other frame through a differentiable composition layer. By utilizing temporal information to perform reasonable estimations on spatio-temporal motion fields, this novel method provides a useful solution for motion tracking and image registration in dynamic medical imaging. Our method has been validated on a representative clinical t-MRI dataset; the experimental results show that our method is superior to conventional motion tracking methods in terms of landmark tracking accuracy and inference efficiency.",2021-03-04T00:42:11Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02772v4

http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00991v1,ProsRegNet: A Deep Learning Framework for Registration of MRI and Histopathology Images of the Prostate,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an increasingly important tool for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. However, interpretation of MRI suffers from high inter-observer variability across radiologists, thereby contributing to missed clinically significant cancers, overdiagnosed low-risk cancers, and frequent false positives. Interpretation of MRI could be greatly improved by providing radiologists with an answer key that clearly shows cancer locations on MRI. Registration of histopathology images from patients who had radical prostatectomy to pre-operative MRI allows such mapping of ground truth cancer labels onto MRI. However, traditional MRI-histopathology registration approaches are computationally expensive and require careful choices of the cost function and registration hyperparameters. This paper presents ProsRegNet, a deep learning-based pipeline to accelerate and simplify MRI-histopathology image registration in prostate cancer. Our pipeline consists of image preprocessing, estimation of affine and deformable transformations by deep neural networks, and mapping cancer labels from histopathology images onto MRI using estimated transformations. We trained our neural network using MR and histopathology images of 99 patients from our internal cohort (Cohort 1) and evaluated its performance using 53 patients from three different cohorts (an additional 12 from Cohort 1 and 41 from two public cohorts). Results show that our deep learning pipeline has achieved more accurate registration results and is at least 20 times faster than a state-of-the-art registration algorithm. This important advance will provide radiologists with highly accurate prostate MRI answer keys, thereby facilitating improvements in the detection of prostate cancer on MRI.

For many neurological conditions, this delay can result in increased morbidity and mortality. An automated triaging tool could reduce reporting times for abnormal examinations by identifying abnormalities at the time of imaging and prioritizing the reporting of these scans. In this work, we present a convolutional neural network for detecting clinically-relevant abnormalities in $\text{T}_2$-weighted head MRI scans. Using a validated neuroradiology report classifier, we generated a labelled dataset of 43,754 scans from two large UK hospitals for model training, and demonstrate accurate classification (area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) = 0.943) on a test set of 800 scans labelled by a team of neuroradiologists. Importantly, when trained on scans from only a single hospital the model generalized to scans from the other hospital ($Δ$AUC $\leq$ 0.02).

Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) MRI acquired by multi-shot techniques can achieve higher resolution, better signal-to-noise ratio, and lower geometric distortion than single-shot, but suffers from inter-shot motion-induced artifacts. These artifacts cannot be removed prospectively, leading to the absence of artifact-free training labels. Thus, the potential of deep learning in multi-shot DWI reconstruction remains largely untapped. To break the training data bottleneck, here, we propose a Physics-Informed Deep DWI reconstruction method (PIDD) to synthesize high-quality paired training data by leveraging the physical diffusion model (magnitude synthesis) and inter-shot motion-induced phase model (motion phase synthesis). The network is trained only once with 100,000 synthetic samples, achieving encouraging results on multiple realistic in vivo data reconstructions. Advantages over conventional methods include: (a) Better motion artifact suppression and reconstruction stability; (b) Outstanding generalization to multi-scenario reconstructions, including multi-resolution, multi-b-value, multi-under-sampling, multi-vendor, and multi-center; (c) Excellent clinical adaptability to patients with verifications by seven experienced doctors (p<0.001).

To address these issues, we design a 3D content-adaptive hyper-network for MRI BIQA. The overall 3D configuration enables the exploration of comprehensive 3D spatial information from MRI images, while the developed content-adaptive hyper-network contributes to the self-adaptive capacity of network parameters and thus, facilitates better BIQA performance. The effectiveness of the proposed method is extensively evaluated on the open dataset, MRIQC.

However, the requirement of excessive high-quality ground-truth data hinders their applications due to the generalization problem. Recently, Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has appeared as a powerful DL-based tool for solving the inverse problem by characterizing the attributes of a signal as a continuous function of corresponding coordinates in an unsupervised manner. In this work, we proposed an INR-based method to improve dynamic MRI reconstruction from highly undersampled k-space data, which only takes spatiotemporal coordinates as inputs. Specifically, the proposed INR represents the dynamic MRI images as an implicit function and encodes them into neural networks. The weights of the network are learned from sparsely-acquired (k, t)-space data itself only, without external training datasets or prior images. Benefiting from the strong implicit continuity regularization of INR together with explicit regularization for low-rankness and sparsity, our proposed method outperforms the compared scan-specific methods at various acceleration factors. E.g., experiments on retrospective cardiac cine datasets show an improvement of 5.5 ~ 7.1 dB in PSNR for extremely high accelerations (up to 41.6-fold). The high-quality and inner continuity of the images provided by INR has great potential to further improve the spatiotemporal resolution of dynamic MRI, without the need of any training data.",2022-12-31T05:43:21Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00127v2

It plays a pivotal role in high-level brain functions such as memory, emotion, and sensation. However, the specific form of molecular transport within the ECS remain elusive. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel approach to quantitatively analyze the molecular transport within the ECS by solving an inverse problem derived from the advection-diffusion equation (ADE) using a physics-informed neural network (PINN). PINN provides a streamlined solution to the ADE without the need for intricate mathematical formulations or grid settings. Additionally, the optimization of PINN facilitates the automatic computation of the diffusion coefficient governing long-term molecule transport and the velocity of molecules driven by advection.

However, the performance and generalisability of the deep learning model are highly dependent on the quantity and quality of the training data set. Both collecting and annotating brain MRI data are extremely time-consuming.

Different from the existing GAN-based methods, we integrate a task-guided branch (a regression model for age estimation) to the end of the generator in GAN. By adding a task-guided loss to the conventional GAN loss, the learned low-dimensional latent space and the synthesised images are more task-specific. It helps to boost the performance of the down-stream task by combining the synthesised images and real images for model training.

Moreover, three-dimensional (3D) FSE provides high-isotropic-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) images of knee joints, but it has a reduced signal-to-noise ratio compared to 2D FSE. Deep-learning denoising methods are a promising approach for denoising MR images, but they are often trained using synthetic noise due to challenges in obtaining true noise distributions for MR images. In this study, inherent true noise information from 2-NEX acquisition was used to develop a deep-learning model based on residual learning of convolutional neural network (CNN), and this model was used to suppress the noise in 3D FSE MR images of knee joints. The proposed CNN used two-step residual learning over parallel transporting and residual blocks and was designed to comprehensively learn real noise features from 2-NEX training data. The results of an ablation study validated the network design. The new method achieved improved denoising performance of 3D FSE knee MR images compared with current state-of-the-art methods, based on the peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index measure. The improved image quality after denoising using the new method was verified by radiological evaluation. A deep CNN using the inherent spatial-varying noise information in 2-NEX acquisitions was developed. This method showed promise for clinical MRI assessments of the knee, and has potential applications for the assessment of other anatomical structures.",2022-04-21T03:45:11Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10773v1
http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02471v3,Accelerated MRI with Un-trained Neural Networks,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are highly effective for image reconstruction problems. Typically, CNNs are trained on large amounts of training images. Recently, however, un-trained CNNs such as the Deep Image Prior and Deep Decoder have achieved excellent performance for image reconstruction problems such as denoising and inpainting, \emph{without using any training data}. Motivated by this development, we address the reconstruction problem arising in accelerated MRI with un-trained neural networks. We propose a highly optimized un-trained recovery approach based on a variation of the Deep Decoder and show that it significantly outperforms other un-trained methods, in particular sparsity-based classical compressed sensing methods and naive applications of un-trained neural networks. We also compare performance (both in terms of reconstruction accuracy and computational cost) in an ideal setup for trained methods, specifically on the fastMRI dataset, where the training and test data come from the same distribution. We find that our un-trained algorithm achieves similar performance to a baseline trained neural network, but a state-of-the-art trained network outperforms the un-trained one. Finally, we perform a comparison on a non-ideal setup where the train and test distributions are slightly different, and find that our un-trained method achieves similar performance to a state-of-the-art accelerated MRI reconstruction method.",2020-07-06T00:01:25Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02471v3

However, the drawback of prolonged scan times hinders its accessibility. The k-space undersampling offers a solution, yet the resultant artifacts necessitate meticulous removal during image reconstruction. Although Deep Learning (DL) has proven effective for fast MRI image reconstruction, its broader applicability across various imaging scenarios has been constrained. Challenges include the high cost and privacy restrictions associated with acquiring large-scale, diverse training data, coupled with the inherent difficulty of addressing mismatches between training and target data in existing DL methodologies. Here, we present a novel Physics-Informed Synthetic data learning framework for Fast MRI, called PISF. PISF marks a breakthrough by enabling generalized DL for multi-scenario MRI reconstruction through a single trained model. Our approach separates the reconstruction of a 2D image into many 1D basic problems, commencing with 1D data synthesis to facilitate generalization. We demonstrate that training DL models on synthetic data, coupled with enhanced learning techniques, yields in vivo MRI reconstructions comparable to or surpassing those of models trained on matched realistic datasets, reducing the reliance on real-world MRI data by up to 96%. Additionally, PISF exhibits remarkable generalizability across multiple vendors and imaging centers.

Specifically, we show that PINNs can be flexibly designed based on the full-vector Maxwell's equations to inversely retrieve the spatial distributions of the complex electric permittivity and magnetic permeability of unknown scattering objects in the resonance regime from near-field data. Moreover, we demonstrate that PINNs achieve excellent convergence to the true material parameters under both plane wave and point source (localized) excitations, enabling parameter retrieval in scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM). Our method is computationally efficient compared to traditional data-driven deep learning approaches as it requires only a single dataset for training. Furthermore, we develop and successfully demonstrate adaptive PINNs with trainable loss weights that largely improve the accuracy of the inverse reconstruction for high-index materials compared to standard PINNs. Finally, we demonstrate the full potential of our approach by retrieving the space-dependent permittivity of a three-dimensional (3D) unknown object from near-field data.

Deep learning based MRI super resolution methods can reduce scan time without complicated sequence programming, but may create additional artifacts due to the discrepancy between training data and testing data. Data consistency layer can improve the deep learning results but needs raw k-space data. In this work, we propose a magnitude-image based data consistency deep learning MRI super resolution method to improve super resolution images' quality without raw k-space data.

In turbo spin echo sequences (TSE) the sequence parameters can have a strong influence on the actual resolution of the acquired image and have consequently a considera-ble impact on the performance of the NN. We propose a known-operator learning approach to perform an end-to-end optimization of MR sequence and neural net-work parameters for SR-TSE. This MR-physics-informed training procedure jointly optimizes the radiofrequency pulse train of a proton density- (PD-) and T2-weighted TSE and a subsequently applied convolutional neural network to predict the corresponding PDw and T2w super-resolution TSE images. The found radiofrequency pulse train designs generate an optimal signal for the NN to perform the SR task. Our method generalizes from the simulation-based optimi-zation to in vivo measurements and the acquired physics-informed SR images show higher correlation with a time-consuming segmented high-resolution TSE sequence compared to a pure network training approach.,2023-05-12T14:40:25Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07524v1

However, previous networks have not fully explored the impact of complex-valued networks in the frequency domain. Here, we introduce a unified complex-valued deep learning framework-Artificial Fourier Transform Network (AFTNet)-which combines domain-manifold learning and CVNNs. AFTNet can be readily used to solve image inverse problems in domain transformation, especially for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction and other applications. While conventional methods typically utilize magnitude images or treat the real and imaginary components of k-space data as separate channels, our approach directly processes raw k-space data in the frequency domain, utilizing complex-valued operations. This allows for a mapping between the frequency (k-space) and image domain to be determined through cross-domain learning. We show that AFTNet achieves superior accelerated MRI reconstruction compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, our approach can be applied to various tasks, such as denoised magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) reconstruction and datasets with various contrasts. The AFTNet presented here is a valuable preprocessing component for different preclinical studies and provides an innovative alternative for solving inverse problems in imaging and spectroscopy.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07740v1,Geometric Approaches to Increase the Expressivity of Deep Neural Networks for MR Reconstruction,"Recently, deep learning approaches have been extensively investigated to reconstruct images from accelerated magnetic resonance image (MRI) acquisition. Although these approaches provide significant performance gain compared to compressed sensing MRI (CS-MRI), it is not clear how to choose a suitable network architecture to balance the trade-off between network complexity and performance. Recently, it was shown that an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network (CNN) can be interpreted as a piecewise linear basis-like representation, whose specific representation is determined by the ReLU activation patterns for a given input image. Thus, the expressivity or the representation power is determined by the number of piecewise linear regions. As an extension of this geometric understanding, this paper proposes a systematic geometric approach using bootstrapping and subnetwork aggregation using an attention module to increase the expressivity of the underlying neural network. Our method can be implemented in both k-space domain and image domain that can be trained in an end-to-end manner.

However, a fundamental challenge is posed when trying to solve the inverse problem of inferring the underlying source-configuration based on measurement data. A key difficulty arises from the fact that such reconstructions often involve ill-posed transformations and that they are prone to numerical artefacts. Here, we develop a numerically efficient method to tackle this inverse problem for the reconstruction of magnetisation maps from measured magnetic stray field images. Our method is based on neural networks with physically inferred loss functions to efficiently eliminate common numerical artefacts. We report on a significant improvement in reconstruction over traditional methods and we show that our approach is robust to different magnetisation directions, both in- and out-of-plane, and to variations of the magnetic field measurement axis orientation. While we showcase the performance of our method using magnetometry with Nitrogen Vacancy centre spins in diamond, our neural-network-based approach to solving inverse problems is agnostic to the measurement technique and thus is applicable beyond the specific use-case demonstrated in this work.",2022-07-27T18:00:08Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13720v1

Current approaches rely on preparing the data with multiple preprocessing steps, such as registering voxels to a standardized brain atlas, which yields a significant computational overhead, hampers widespread usage and results in the predicted brain-age to be sensitive to preprocessing parameters. Here we describe a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the ResNet architecture being trained on raw, non-registered T$_ 1$-weighted MRI data of N=10,691 samples from the German National Cohort and additionally applied and validated in N=2,173 samples from three independent studies using transfer learning.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03320v3,CoNeS: Conditional neural fields with shift modulation for multi-sequence MRI translation,"Multi-sequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has found wide applications in both modern clinical studies and deep learning research. However, in clinical practice, it frequently occurs that one or more of the MRI sequences are missing due to different image acquisition protocols or contrast agent contraindications of patients, limiting the utilization of deep learning models trained on multi-sequence data. One promising approach is to leverage generative models to synthesize the missing sequences, which can serve as a surrogate acquisition. State-of-the-art methods tackling this problem are based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) which usually suffer from spectral biases, resulting in poor reconstruction of high-frequency fine details. In this paper, we propose Conditional Neural fields with Shift modulation (CoNeS), a model that takes voxel coordinates as input and learns a representation of the target images for multi-sequence MRI translation. The proposed model uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) instead of a CNN as the decoder for pixel-to-pixel mapping. Hence, each target image is represented as a neural field that is conditioned on the source image via shift modulation with a learned latent code. Experiments on BraTS 2018 and an in-house clinical dataset of vestibular schwannoma patients showed that the proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art methods for multi-sequence MRI translation both visually and quantitatively. Moreover, we conducted spectral analysis, showing that CoNeS was able to overcome the spectral bias issue common in conventional CNN models.

Despite its potential for research, this vast amount of data presents a challenge to established methods of evaluation, which often rely on manual input. To date, the range of reference values for cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors is therefore incomplete. In this work, neural networks were trained for image-based regression to infer various biological metrics from the neck-to-knee body MRI automatically. The approach requires no manual intervention or direct access to reference segmentations for training. The examined fields span 64 variables derived from anthropometric measurements, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), atlas-based segmentations, and dedicated liver scans. With the ResNet50, the standardized framework achieves a close fit to the target values (median R^2 > 0.97) in cross-validation.

To address this problem, we propose the following: (1) a novel convolutional operator called Faster Fourier Convolution (FasterFC) to replace the two consecutive convolution operations typically used in convolutional neural networks (e.g., U-Net, ResNet). Based on the spectral convolution theorem in Fourier theory, FasterFC employs alternating kernels of size 1 in 3D case) in different domains to extend the dual-domain receptive field to the global and achieves faster calculation speed than traditional Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC).

Medical image super-resolution (SR) reconstruction using deep learning techniques can enhance lesion analysis and assist doctors in improving diagnostic efficiency and accuracy. However, existing deep learning-based SR methods predominantly rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which inherently limit the expressive capabilities of these models and therefore make it challenging to discover potential relationships between different image features. To overcome this limitation, we propose an A-network that utilizes multiple convolution operator feature extraction modules (MCO) for extracting image features using multiple convolution operators. These extracted features are passed through multiple sets of cross-feature extraction modules (MSC) to highlight key features through inter-channel feature interactions, enabling subsequent feature learning. An attention-based sparse graph neural network module is incorporated to establish relationships between pixel features, learning which adjacent pixels have the greatest impact on determining the features to be filled.

The method uses a new multi-tasking strategy, where both the tasks of cardiac segmentation and orientation recognition are simultaneously achieved. For multiple sequences and modalities of MRI, we propose a transfer learning strategy, which adapts our proposed model from a single modality to multiple modalities. We embed the orientation recognition network in a Cardiac MRI Orientation Adjust Tool, i.e., CMRadjustNet. We implemented two versions of CMRadjustNet, including a user-interface (UI) software, and a command-line tool.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06217v1,Medical Image Segmentation on MRI Images with Missing Modalities: A Review,"Dealing with missing modalities in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and overcoming their negative repercussions is considered a hurdle in biomedical imaging. The combination of a specified set of modalities, which is selected depending on the scenario and anatomical part being scanned, will provide medical practitioners with full information about the region of interest in the human body, hence the missing MRI sequences should be reimbursed. The compensation of the adverse impact of losing useful information owing to the lack of one or more modalities is a well-known challenge in the field of computer vision, particularly for medical image processing tasks including tumour segmentation, tissue classification, and image generation. Various approaches have been developed over time to mitigate this problem's negative implications and this literature review goes through a significant number of the networks that seek to do so. The approaches reviewed in this work are reviewed in detail, including earlier techniques such as synthesis methods as well as later approaches that deploy deep learning, such as common latent space models, knowledge distillation networks, mutual information maximization, and generative adversarial networks (GANs). This work discusses the most important approaches that have been offered at the time of this writing, examining the novelty, strength, and weakness of each one. Furthermore, the most commonly used MRI datasets are highlighted and described.

An early detection can prevent the patient from further damage of the brain cells and hence avoid permanent memory loss. In past few years, various automatic tools and techniques have been proposed for diagnosis of AD. Several methods focus on fast, accurate and early detection of the disease to minimize the loss to patients mental health. Although machine learning and deep learning techniques have significantly improved medical imaging systems for AD by providing diagnostic performance close to human level. But the main problem faced during multi-class classification is the presence of highly correlated features in the brain structure. In this paper, we have proposed a smart and accurate way of diagnosing AD based on a two-dimensional deep convolutional neural network (2D-DCNN) using imbalanced three-dimensional MRI dataset. Experimental results on Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset confirms that the proposed 2D-DCNN model is superior in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.

The current diagnostic procedure uses patient assessments to evaluate symptoms and sometimes a magnetic resonance imaging or MRI scan. However, symptom variations cause inaccurate assessments, and the analysis of MRI scans requires experienced specialists. This research proposes to accurately diagnose PD severity with deep learning by combining symptoms data and MRI data from the Parkinsons Progression Markers Initiative database. A new hybrid model architecture was implemented to fully utilize both forms of clinical data, and models based on only symptoms and only MRI scans were also developed. The symptoms based model integrates a fully connected deep learning neural network, and the MRI scans and hybrid models integrate transfer learning based convolutional neural networks. Instead of performing only binary classification, all models diagnose patients into five severity categories, with stage zero representing healthy patients and stages four and five representing patients with PD. The symptoms only, MRI scans only, and hybrid models achieved accuracies of 0.77, 0.68, and 0.94, respectively. The hybrid model also had high precision and recall scores of 0.94 and 0.95. Real clinical cases confirm the strong performance of the hybrid, where patients were classified incorrectly with both other models but correctly by the hybrid. It is also consistent across the five severity stages, indicating accurate early detection. This is the first report to combine symptoms data and MRI scans with a machine learning approach on such a large scale.",2022-01-12T15:51:54Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04631v1

To achieve this goal, we incorporate image preprocessing steps, including normalization, data augmentation, and a cropping technique designed to reduce background noise and emphasize relevant regions. The CNN architecture is optimized through hyperparameter tuning using Keras Tuner, enabling systematic exploration of network parameters. To ensure reliable evaluation, we apply 5-fold cross-validation, where each hyperparameter configuration is evaluated across multiple data splits to mitigate overfitting.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02613v1,Learning Deep MRI Reconstruction Models from Scratch in Low-Data Regimes,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an essential diagnostic tool that suffers from prolonged scan times. Reconstruction methods can alleviate this limitation by recovering clinically usable images from accelerated acquisitions. In particular, learning-based methods promise performance leaps by employing deep neural networks as data-driven priors. A powerful approach uses scan-specific (SS) priors that leverage information regarding the underlying physical signal model for reconstruction. SS priors are learned on each individual test scan without the need for a training dataset, albeit they suffer from computationally burdening inference with nonlinear networks. An alternative approach uses scan-general (SG) priors that instead leverage information regarding the latent features of MRI images for reconstruction. SG priors are frozen at test time for efficiency, albeit they require learning from a large training dataset. Here, we introduce a novel parallel-stream fusion model (PSFNet) that synergistically fuses SS and SG priors for performant MRI reconstruction in low-data regimes, while maintaining competitive inference times to SG methods. PSFNet implements its SG prior based on a nonlinear network, yet it forms its SS prior based on a linear network to maintain efficiency. A pervasive framework for combining multiple priors in MRI reconstruction is algorithmic unrolling that uses serially alternated projections, causing error propagation under low-data regimes. To alleviate error propagation, PSFNet combines its SS and SG priors via a novel parallel-stream architecture with learnable fusion parameters. Demonstrations are performed on multi-coil brain MRI for varying amounts of training data. PSFNet outperforms SG methods in low-data regimes, and surpasses SS methods with few tens of training samples.",2023-01-06T17:26:03Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02613v1

While PINNs have been explored for their utility in inverse analysis, their application in acoustic analysis remains limited. This study presents a method to identify loss parameters in acoustic tubes using PINNs. We categorized the loss parameters into two groups: one dependent on the tube's diameter and another constant, independent of it. The latter were set as the trainable parameters of the neural network. The problem of identifying the loss parameter was formulated as an optimization problem, with the physical properties being determined through this process. The neural network architecture employed was based on our previously proposed ResoNet, which is designed for analyzing acoustic resonance. The efficacy of the proposed method is assessed through both forward and inverse analysis, specifically through the identification of loss parameters. The findings demonstrate that it is feasible to accurately identify parameters that significantly impact the sound field under analysis. By merely altering the governing equations in the loss function, this method could be adapted to various sound fields, suggesting its potential for broad application.",2024-06-17T00:41:26Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11119v1

But it is very troublesome to configure different deep networks when the sampling setting changes. In this work, we propose a deep plug-and-play method for undersampled MRI reconstruction, which effectively adapts to different sampling settings. Specifically, the image de-aliasing prior is first learned by a deep denoiser trained to remove general white Gaussian noise from synthetic data. Then the learned deep denoiser is plugged into an iterative algorithm for image reconstruction. Results on in vivo data demonstrate that the proposed method provides nice and robust accelerated image reconstruction performance under different undersampling patterns and sampling rates, both visually and quantitatively.",2023-09-13T02:37:19Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06681v2

Motion during acquisition has a profound impact on workflow efficiency, often requiring a repeat of sequences. Furthermore, motion artifacts may escape notice by technologists, only to be revealed at the time of reading by the radiologists, affecting their diagnostic quality. Designing a computer-aided tool for automatic motion detection and elimination can improve the diagnosis, however, it needs a deep understanding of motion characteristics. Motion artifacts in MRI have a complex nature and it is directly related to the k-space sampling scheme. In this study we investigate the effect of three conventional k-space samplers, including Cartesian, Uniform Spiral and Radial on motion induced image distortion. In this regard, various synthetic motions with different trajectories of displacement and rotation are applied to T1 and T2-weighted MRI images, and a convolutional neural network is trained to show the difficulty of motion classification. The results show that the spiral k-space sampling method get less effect of motion artifact in image space as compared to radial k-space sampled images, and radial k-space sampled images are more robust than Cartesian ones. Cartesian samplers, on the other hand, are the best in terms of deep learning motion detection because they can better reflect motion.",2021-03-15T16:38:40Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08516v1

As a result, fast MRI reconstruction has become a significant area of research. In recent years, Implicit Neural Representation (INR), as a scan-specific method, has demonstrated outstanding performance in fast MRI reconstruction without fully-sampled images for training. High acceleration reconstruction poses a challenging problem, and a key component in achieving high-quality reconstruction with much few data is the accurate estimation of coil sensitivity maps. However, most INR-based methods apply regularization constraints solely to the generated images, while overlooking the characteristics of the coil sensitivity maps. To handle this, this work proposes a joint coil sensitivity map and image estimation network, termed INR-CRISTAL. The proposed INR-CRISTAL introduces an extra sensitivity map regularization in the INR networks to make use of the smooth characteristics of the sensitivity maps. Experimental results show that INR-CRISTAL provides more accurate coil sensitivity estimates with fewer artifacts, and delivers superior reconstruction performance in terms of artifact removal and structure preservation.

Previous works on the localization problem may be categorized separately into model-based optimization and neural network approaches. Our PiLocNet combines the unique strengths of both approaches by incorporating forward-model-based information into the network via a data-fitting loss term that constrains the neural network to yield results that are physically sensible. We additionally incorporate certain regularization terms from the variational method, which further improves the robustness of the network in the presence of image noise, as we show for the Poisson and Gaussian noise models. This framework accords interpretability to the neural network, and the results we obtain show its superiority.

To enhance state estimation results, we consider various design and training techniques for PINNs, including adaptive loss balancing, curriculum training, and a realistic measurement operator. Regarding blood rheology, the PINN approach accurately estimates viscosity globally and locally under peak systolic conditions. It also provides a clear pattern recognition for diastolic stages. Regarding mass conservation, PINN estimations effectively reproduce the bifurcation of flow through the different branches of the aorta, demonstrate an excellent representation of the non-slip conditions at the walls, and accurately estimate pressure drops with relative errors below the 5% in the whole pressure field. We test our pressure drop estimations against the state of the art Virtual Work Energy Relative Pressure (vWERP) estimator, and we observe how our results outperform vWERP in terms of both accuracy and time resolution.

However, it is often difficult to obtain full-sequence MRI images of patients owing to limitations such as time consumption and high cost. The purpose of this work is to develop an algorithm for target MRI sequences prediction with high accuracy, and provide more information for clinical diagnosis. Methods: We propose a deep learning based multi-modal computing model for MRI synthesis with feature disentanglement strategy. To take full advantage of the complementary information provided by different modalities, multi-modal MRI sequences are utilized as input. Notably, the proposed approach decomposes each input modality into modality-invariant space with shared information and modality-specific space with specific information, so that features are extracted separately to effectively process the input data. Subsequently, both of them are fused through the adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) layer in the decoder. In addition, to address the lack of specific information of the target modality in the test phase, a local adaptive fusion (LAF) module is adopted to generate a modality-like pseudo-target with specific information similar to the ground truth. Results: To evaluate the synthesis performance, we verify our method on the BRATS2015 dataset of 164 subjects.

Also, as we focus on the inverse problems, we call this method BPINN-IP, and we show that the standard PINN formulation naturally appears as its special case corresponding to the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimate. This unified formulation allows simultaneous exploitation of physical constraints, prior knowledge, and data-driven inference, while enabling uncertainty quantification through posterior distributions.

To overcome this limitation, this paper incorporates a complete physical model representing the THz image formation process into traditional DL networks to retrieve the depth information of objects. The most significant advantage is the ability to use it without pre-training, thereby eliminating the need for tens of thousands of labeled data. Through experiments validation, we demonstrate that by providing diffraction patterns of planar objects with their upper and lower halves individually masked, the proposed physics-informed neural network (NN) can automatically optimize and, ultimately, reconstruct the depth of the object through interaction between the NN and a physical model.

Interpretable neural network models are of significant interest since they enhance the trustworthiness required in clinical practice when dealing with medical images. 2) most existing SR reconstruction approaches only use a single contrast or use a simple multi-contrast fusion mechanism, neglecting the complex relationships between different contrasts that are critical for SR improvement.

Our approach utilizes latent diffusion models and a two-step generative process: first, unobserved physical tissue property maps are synthesized using a latent diffusion model, and then these maps are combined with a physical signal model to generate the final MRI scan. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of this approach in generating unseen MR contrasts and preserving physical plausibility. Furthermore, we validate the distributions of generated tissue properties by comparing them to those measured in real brain tissue.",2024-09-20T14:21:34Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13532v2

Thus, motion correction is crucial to obtain high-quality T2* maps.   Methods: We extend our previously introduced learning-based physics-informed motion correction method, PHIMO, by utilizing acquisition knowledge to enhance the reconstruction performance for challenging motion patterns and increase PHIMO's robustness to varying strengths of magnetic field inhomogeneities across the brain. We perform comprehensive evaluations regarding motion detection accuracy and image quality for data with simulated and real motion.   Results: Our extended version of PHIMO outperforms the learning-based baseline methods both qualitatively and quantitatively with respect to line detection and image quality. Moreover, PHIMO performs on-par with a conventional state-of-the-art motion correction method for T2* quantification from gradient echo MRI, which relies on redundant data acquisition.   Conclusion: PHIMO's competitive motion correction performance, combined with a reduction in acquisition time by over 40% compared to the state-of-the-art method, make it a promising solution for motion-robust T2* quantification in research settings and clinical routine.",2025-02-24T14:41:53Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17209v1

However, current 4D-MRI suffers from low spatial resolution and strong motion artifacts owing to the long acquisition time and patients' respiratory variations; these limitations, if not managed properly, can adversely affect treatment planning and delivery in IGRT. Herein, we developed a novel deep learning framework called the coarse-super-resolution-fine network (CoSF-Net) to achieve simultaneous motion estimation and super-resolution in a unified model. We designed CoSF-Net by fully excavating the inherent properties of 4D-MRI, with consideration of limited and imperfectly matched training datasets. We conducted extensive experiments on multiple real patient datasets to verify the feasibility and robustness of the developed network. Compared with existing networks and three state-of-the-art conventional algorithms, CoSF-Net not only accurately estimated the deformable vector fields between the respiratory phases of 4D-MRI but also simultaneously improved the spatial resolution of 4D-MRI with enhanced anatomic features, yielding 4D-MR images with high spatiotemporal resolution.",2022-11-21T01:42:51Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11144v1

However, the approaches of robustifying these models are underdeveloped. Compared to image classification, it could be much more challenging to achieve a robust MRI image reconstruction network considering its regression-based learning objective, limited amount of training data, and lack of efficient robustness metrics. To circumvent the above limitations, our work revisits the problem of DL-based image reconstruction through the lens of robust machine learning. We find a new instability source of MRI image reconstruction, i.e., the lack of reconstruction robustness against spatial transformations of an input, e.g., rotation and cutout. Inspired by this new robustness metric, we develop a robustness-aware image reconstruction method that can defend against both pixel-wise adversarial perturbations as well as spatial transformations.

In this direction of research, this work introduces a physics-informed neural network (PiNN) designed to learn the unknown parameters of an interpretable wildfire spreading model. The considered modeling approach integrates fundamental physical laws articulated by key model parameters essential for capturing the complex behavior of wildfires. The proposed machine learning framework leverages the theory of artificial neural networks with the physical constraints governing wildfire dynamics, including the first principles of mass and energy conservation. Training of the PiNN for physics-informed parameter identification is realized using synthetic data on the spatiotemporal evolution of one- and two-dimensional firefronts, derived from a high-fidelity simulator, as well as empirical data (ground surface thermal images) from the Troy Fire that occurred on June 19, 2002, in California. The parameter learning results demonstrate the predictive ability of the proposed PiNN in uncovering the unknown coefficients of the wildfire model in one- and two-dimensional fire spreading scenarios as well as the Troy Fire. Additionally, this methodology exhibits robustness by identifying the same parameters even in the presence of noisy data.

However, network architectures adopted in previous methods are all designed by handcraft. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithms can automatically build neural network architectures which have outperformed human designed ones in several vision tasks. Inspired by this, here we proposed a novel and efficient network for the MR image reconstruction problem via NAS instead of manual attempts. Particularly, a specific cell structure, which was integrated into the model-driven MR reconstruction pipeline, was automatically searched from a flexible pre-defined operation search space in a differentiable manner. Experimental results show that our searched network can produce better reconstruction results compared to previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of PSNR and SSIM with 4-6 times fewer computation resources. Extensive experiments were conducted to analyze how hyper-parameters affect reconstruction performance and the searched structures. The generalizability of the searched architecture was also evaluated on different organ MR datasets.

However, image quality is a crucial factor that influences the accuracy of clinical diagnosis; hence, high-quality image reconstruction from undersampled measurements has been a key area of research. Recently, deep learning (DL) methods have emerged as the state-of-the-art for MRI reconstruction, typically involving deep neural networks to transform undersampled MRI images into high-quality MRI images through data-driven processes. Nevertheless, there is clear and significant room for improvement in undersampled DL MRI reconstruction to meet the high standards required for clinical diagnosis, in terms of eliminating aliasing artifacts and reducing image noise. In this paper, we introduce a self-supervised pretraining procedure using contrastive learning to improve the accuracy of undersampled DL MRI reconstruction. We use contrastive learning to transform the MRI image representations into a latent space that maximizes mutual information among different undersampled representations and optimizes the information content at the input of the downstream DL reconstruction models. Our experiments demonstrate improved reconstruction accuracy across a range of acceleration factors and datasets, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Furthermore, our extended experiments validate the proposed framework's robustness under adversarial conditions, such as measurement noise, different k-space sampling patterns, and pathological abnormalities, and also prove the transfer learning capabilities on MRI datasets with completely different anatomy.

In this paper we describe Visual-Motion-Focus (VMF), a module that detects the heart motion in the 4D MRI sequence, and highlights ROIs by focusing a Radial Basis Function (RBF) on the estimated motion field. We experimented and evaluated VMF on three CMR datasets, observing that the proposed ROIs cover 99.7% of data labels (Recall score), improved the CNN segmentation (mean Dice score) by 1.7 (p < .001) after the ROI extraction, and improved the overall training speed by 2.5 times (+150%).",2021-07-19T20:19:40Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09134v1

Previous work demonstrates that INRs improve rapid MRI through inherent regularization imposed by neural network architectures. Typically parameterized by fully-connected neural networks, INRs support continuous image representations by taking a physical coordinate location as input and outputting the intensity at that coordinate. Previous work has applied unlearned regularization priors during INR training and have been limited to 2D or low-resolution 3D acquisitions. Meanwhile, diffusion based generative models have received recent attention as they learn powerful image priors decoupled from the measurement model. This work proposes INFusion, a technique that regularizes the optimization of INRs from under-sampled MR measurements with pre-trained diffusion models for improved image reconstruction. In addition, we propose a hybrid 3D approach with our diffusion regularization that enables INR application on large-scale 3D MR datasets. 2D experiments demonstrate improved INR training with our proposed diffusion regularization, and 3D experiments demonstrate feasibility of INR training with diffusion regularization on 3D matrix sizes of 256 by 256 by 80.",2024-06-19T23:51:26Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13895v2

However, geometric distortions caused by gradient nonlinearity (GNL) limit anatomical accuracy, potentially compromising the quality of tumour treatments. In addition, slow MR acquisition and reconstruction limit the potential for real-time image guidance. Here, we demonstrate a deep learning-based method that rapidly reconstructs distortion-corrected images from raw k-space data for real-time MR-guided radiotherapy applications. We leverage recent advances in interpretable unrolling networks to develop a Distortion-Corrected Reconstruction Network (DCReconNet) that applies convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn effective regularizations and nonuniform fast Fourier transforms for GNL-encoding. DCReconNet was trained on a public MR brain dataset from eleven healthy volunteers for fully sampled and accelerated techniques including parallel imaging (PI) and compressed sensing (CS). The performance of DCReconNet was tested on phantom and volunteer brain data acquired on a 1.0T MRI-Linac. The DCReconNet, CS- and PI-based reconstructed image quality was measured by structural similarity (SSIM) and root-mean-squared error (RMSE) for numerical comparisons. The computation time for each method was also reported. Phantom and volunteer results demonstrated that DCReconNet better preserves image structure when compared to CS- and PI-based reconstruction methods. DCReconNet resulted in highest SSIM (0.95 median value) and lowest RMSE (<0.04) on simulated brain images with four times acceleration. DCReconNet is over 100-times faster than iterative, regularized reconstruction methods.

For SIM imaging, there exists a need for a flexible, general, and open-source reconstruction method that can be readily adapted to different forms of structured illumination. We demonstrate that we can combine a deep neural network with the forward model of the structured illumination process to reconstruct sub-diffraction images without training data. The resulting physics-informed neural network (PINN) can be optimized on a single set of diffraction limited sub-images and thus doesn't require any training set.

In this work, we address this inherent limitation of unrolled networks, drawing inspiration from recent Flow Matching paradigm. We first theoretically prove that unrolled networks are discretizations of conditional probability flows. This connection shows that unrolled networks and Flow Matching are analogous in MRI reconstruction. Building upon this insight, we propose FLow-Aligned Training (FLAT), which (1) derives important cascade parameters from the Flow Matching discretization; and (2) aligns intermediate reconstructions with the ideal Flow Matching trajectory to improve cascade iteration stability and convergence.

This work proposes a method that uses Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to estimate patient-specific parameters of a reaction-diffusion PDE model of GBM growth from a single 3D structural MRI snapshot. PINNs embed both the data and the PDE into a loss function, thus integrating theory and data. Key innovations include the identification and estimation of characteristic non-dimensional parameters, a pre-training step that utilizes the non-dimensional parameters and a fine-tuning step to determine the patient specific parameters.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02334v3,Dual Arbitrary Scale Super-Resolution for Multi-Contrast MRI,"Limited by imaging systems, the reconstruction of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images from partial measurement is essential to medical imaging research. Benefiting from the diverse and complementary information of multi-contrast MR images in different imaging modalities, multi-contrast Super-Resolution (SR) reconstruction is promising to yield SR images with higher quality. In the medical scenario, to fully visualize the lesion, radiologists are accustomed to zooming the MR images at arbitrary scales rather than using a fixed scale, as used by most MRI SR methods. In addition, existing multi-contrast MRI SR methods often require a fixed resolution for the reference image, which makes acquiring reference images difficult and imposes limitations on arbitrary scale SR tasks. To address these issues, we proposed an implicit neural representations based dual-arbitrary multi-contrast MRI super-resolution method, called Dual-ArbNet. First, we decouple the resolution of the target and reference images by a feature encoder, enabling the network to input target and reference images at arbitrary scales. Then, an implicit fusion decoder fuses the multi-contrast features and uses an Implicit Decoding Function~(IDF) to obtain the final MRI SR results.

However, the widespread use of 7T MRI is limited by its high cost and lower accessibility compared to low-field (LF) MRI. This study proposes a deep-learning framework that systematically fuses the input LF magnetic resonance feature representations with the inferred 7T-like feature representations for brain image segmentation tasks in a 7T-absent environment. Specifically, our adaptive fusion module aggregates 7T-like features derived from the LF image by a pre-trained network and then refines them to be effectively assimilable UHF guidance into LF image features. Using intensity-guided features obtained from such aggregation and assimilation, segmentation models can recognize subtle structural representations that are usually difficult to recognize when relying only on LF features. Beyond such advantages, this strategy can seamlessly be utilized by modulating the contrast of LF features in alignment with UHF guidance, even when employing arbitrary segmentation models. Exhaustive experiments demonstrated that the proposed method significantly outperformed all baseline models on both brain tissue and whole-brain segmentation tasks; further, it exhibited remarkable adaptability and scalability by successfully integrating diverse segmentation models and tasks.

Traditional ME inversion methods, though widely used, are computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, and often struggle to accurately capture complex profile asymmetries resulting from gradients in magnetic field strength, orientation, and line-of-sight velocities. By embedding the ME radiative transfer equations directly into the neural network training as physics-informed constraints, our MVPinn method robustly and efficiently retrieves magnetic field parameters, significantly outperforming traditional inversion methods in accuracy, noise resilience, and the ability to handle asymmetric and weak polarization signals. After training, MVPinn infers one magnetogram in about 15 seconds, compared to tens of minutes required by traditional ME inversion on high-resolution spectropolarimetric data. Quantitative comparisons demonstrate excellent agreement with well-established magnetic field measurements from the SDO/HMI and Hinode/SOT-SP instruments, with correlation coefficients of approximately 90%. In particular, MVPINN aligns better with Hinode/SOT-SP data, indicating some saturation of HMI data at high magnetic strengths. We further analyze the physical significance of profile asymmetries and the limitations inherent in the ME model assumption. Our results illustrate the potential of physics-informed machine learning methods in high-spatial-temporal solar observations, preparing for more sophisticated, real-time magnetic field analysis essential for current and next-generation solar telescopes and space weather monitoring.",2025-07-12T23:53:46Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09430v1
http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12401v1,MambaRecon: MRI Reconstruction with Structured State Space Models,"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is one of the most important medical imaging modalities as it provides superior resolution of soft tissues, albeit with a notable limitation in scanning speed. The advent of deep learning has catalyzed the development of cutting-edge methods for the expedited reconstruction of MRI scans, utilizing convolutional neural networks and, more recently, vision transformers. Recently proposed structured state space models (e.g., Mamba) have gained some traction due to their efficiency and low computational requirements compared to transformer models. We propose an innovative MRI reconstruction framework that employs structured state space models at its core, aimed at amplifying both long-range contextual sensitivity and reconstruction efficacy.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09446v2,Vox2Cortex: Fast Explicit Reconstruction of Cortical Surfaces from 3D MRI Scans with Geometric Deep Neural Networks,"The reconstruction of cortical surfaces from brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans is essential for quantitative analyses of cortical thickness and sulcal morphology. Although traditional and deep learning-based algorithmic pipelines exist for this purpose, they have two major drawbacks: lengthy runtimes of multiple hours (traditional) or intricate post-processing, such as mesh extraction and topology correction (deep learning-based). In this work, we address both of these issues and propose Vox2Cortex, a deep learning-based algorithm that directly yields topologically correct, three-dimensional meshes of the boundaries of the cortex. Vox2Cortex leverages convolutional and graph convolutional neural networks to deform an initial template to the densely folded geometry of the cortex represented by an input MRI scan. We show in extensive experiments on three brain MRI datasets that our meshes are as accurate as the ones reconstructed by state-of-the-art methods in the field, without the need for time- and resource-intensive post-processing. To accurately reconstruct the tightly folded cortex, we work with meshes containing about 168,000 vertices at test time, scaling deep explicit reconstruction methods to a new level.",2022-03-17T17:06:00Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09446v2

Methods: We construct the similarity graph using embedded features of the input image (i.e., Non-Demented (ND), Very Mild Demented (VMD), Mild Demented (MD), and Moderated Demented (MDTD)). We experiment and compare different dimension-reduction and clustering algorithms to construct the best similarity graph to capture the similarity between the same class images using the cosine distance as a similarity measure. We utilize the similarity graph to present (sample) the training data to a convolutional neural network (CNN). We use the similarity graph as a regularizer in the loss function of a CNN model to minimize the distance between the input images and their k-nearest neighbours in the similarity graph while minimizing the categorical cross-entropy loss between the training image predictions and the actual image class labels. Results: We conduct extensive experiments with several pre-trained CNN models and compare the results to other recent methods. Conclusion: Our method achieves superior performance on the testing dataset (accuracy = 0.986, area under receiver operating characteristics curve = 0.998, F1 measure = 0.987).

http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05603v3,Multi-Modal MRI Reconstruction Assisted with Spatial Alignment Network,"In clinical practice, multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with different contrasts is usually acquired in a single study to assess different properties of the same region of interest in the human body. The whole acquisition process can be accelerated by having one or more modalities under-sampled in the $k$-space. Recent research has shown that, considering the redundancy between different modalities, a target MRI modality under-sampled in the $k$-space can be more efficiently reconstructed with a fully-sampled reference MRI modality. However, we find that the performance of the aforementioned multi-modal reconstruction can be negatively affected by subtle spatial misalignment between different modalities, which is actually common in clinical practice. In this paper, we improve the quality of multi-modal reconstruction by compensating for such spatial misalignment with a spatial alignment network. First, our spatial alignment network estimates the displacement between the fully-sampled reference and the under-sampled target images, and warps the reference image accordingly. Then, the aligned fully-sampled reference image joins the multi-modal reconstruction of the under-sampled target image. Also, considering the contrast difference between the target and reference images, we have designed a cross-modality-synthesis-based registration loss in combination with the reconstruction loss, to jointly train the spatial alignment network and the reconstruction network. The experiments on both clinical MRI and multi-coil $k$-space raw data demonstrate the superiority and robustness of the multi-modal MRI reconstruction empowered with our spatial alignment network.

Its advantage of capturing knee structure in three dimensions makes it the ideal tool for radiologists to locate potential tears in the knee. In order to better confront the ever growing workload of musculoskeletal (MSK) radiologists, automated tools for patients' triage are becoming a real need, reducing delays in the reading of pathological cases. In this work, we present the Efficiently-Layered Network (ELNet), a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture optimized for the task of initial knee MRI diagnosis for triage. Unlike past approaches, we train ELNet from scratch instead of using a transfer-learning approach. The proposed method is validated quantitatively and qualitatively, and compares favorably against state-of-the-art MRNet while using a single imaging stack (axial or coronal) as input. Additionally, we demonstrate our model's capability to locate tears in the knee despite the absence of localization information during training.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09296v1,A Physics-Informed Deep Learning Model for MRI Brain Motion Correction,"Background: MRI is crucial for brain imaging but is highly susceptible to motion artifacts due to long acquisition times. This study introduces PI-MoCoNet, a physics-informed motion correction network that integrates spatial and k-space information to remove motion artifacts without explicit motion parameter estimation, enhancing image fidelity and diagnostic reliability. Materials and Methods: PI-MoCoNet consists of a motion detection network (U-net with spatial averaging) to identify corrupted k-space lines and a motion correction network (U-net with Swin Transformer blocks) to reconstruct motion-free images. The correction is guided by three loss functions: reconstruction (L1), perceptual (LPIPS), and data consistency (Ldc). Motion artifacts were simulated via rigid phase encoding perturbations and evaluated on IXI and MR-ART datasets against Pix2Pix, CycleGAN, and U-net using PSNR, SSIM, and NMSE. Results: PI-MoCoNet significantly improved image quality. On IXI, for minor artifacts, PSNR increased from 34.15 dB to 45.95 dB, SSIM from 0.87 to 1.00, and NMSE reduced from 0.55% to 0.04%. For moderate artifacts, PSNR improved from 30.23 dB to 42.16 dB, SSIM from 0.80 to 0.99, and NMSE from 1.32% to 0.09%. For heavy artifacts, PSNR rose from 27.99 dB to 36.01 dB, SSIM from 0.75 to 0.97, and NMSE decreased from 2.21% to 0.36%. On MR-ART, PI-MoCoNet achieved PSNR gains of ~10 dB and SSIM improvements of up to 0.20, with NMSE reductions of ~6%. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of data consistency and perceptual losses, yielding a 1 dB PSNR gain and 0.17% NMSE reduction. Conclusions: PI-MoCoNet effectively mitigates motion artifacts in brain MRI, outperforming existing methods. Its ability to integrate spatial and k-space information makes it a promising tool for clinical use in motion-prone settings.

However, these techniques sometimes struggle to reconstruct sharp images that preserve fine detail while maintaining a natural appearance. In this work, we enhance the image quality by using a Conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network combined with a novel Adaptive Gradient Balancing (AGB) technique that automates the process of combining the adversarial and pixel-wise terms and streamlines hyperparameter tuning. In addition, we introduce a Densely Connected Iterative Network, which is an undersampled MRI reconstruction network that utilizes dense connections. In MRI, our method minimizes artifacts, while maintaining a high-quality reconstruction that produces sharper images than other techniques. To demonstrate the general nature of our method, it is further evaluated on a battery of image-to-image translation experiments, demonstrating an ability to recover from sub-optimal weighting in multi-term adversarial training.",2021-04-05T13:05:22Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01889v1
http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06628v1,Deep Cardiac MRI Reconstruction with ADMM,"Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is a valuable non-invasive tool for identifying cardiovascular diseases. For instance, Cine MRI is the benchmark modality for assessing the cardiac function and anatomy. On the other hand, multi-contrast (T1 and T2) mapping has the potential to assess pathologies and abnormalities in the myocardium and interstitium. However, voluntary breath-holding and often arrhythmia, in combination with MRI's slow imaging speed, can lead to motion artifacts, hindering real-time acquisition image quality. Although performing accelerated acquisitions can facilitate dynamic imaging, it induces aliasing, causing low reconstructed image quality in Cine MRI and inaccurate T1 and T2 mapping estimation. In this work, inspired by related work in accelerated MRI reconstruction, we present a deep learning (DL)-based method for accelerated cine and multi-contrast reconstruction in the context of dynamic cardiac imaging. We formulate the reconstruction problem as a least squares regularized optimization task, and employ vSHARP, a state-of-the-art DL-based inverse problem solver, which incorporates half-quadratic variable splitting and the alternating direction method of multipliers with neural networks. We treat the problem in two setups; a 2D reconstruction and a 2D dynamic reconstruction task, and employ 2D and 3D deep learning networks, respectively. Our method optimizes in both the image and k-space domains, allowing for high reconstruction fidelity. Although the target data is undersampled with a Cartesian equispaced scheme, we train our model using both Cartesian and simulated non-Cartesian undersampling schemes to enhance generalization of the model to unseen data.

Conventional MSI systems, however, suffer from high cost, complexity, and limited performance in low-light conditions.

In this work, we present a portable multispectral single-pixel imaging (MS-SPI) method that integrates a chip-sized multispectral sensor for system miniaturization and leverages an untrained physics-informed neural network (PINN) to reconstruct high-quality spectral images without the need for labeled training data. The physics-informed structure of the network enables the self-corrected reconstruction of multispectral images directly with the input of raw measurements from the multispectral sensor. Our proof-of-concept prototype achieves the reconstruction of 12-channel high-quality spectral images at the sampling rate of 10%. We also experimentally validate its performance under varying sampling rate conditions, by comparing it with conventional compressive sensing algorithms.

The process of distinguishing tumor boundaries from healthy cells is still a challenging task in the clinical routine. Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) MRI modality can provide the physician with information about tumor infiltration. Therefore, this paper proposes a new generic deep learning architecture; namely DeepSeg for fully automated detection and segmentation of the brain lesion using FLAIR MRI data.

However, SISR for 3D Magnetics Resonance Images (MRI) is more challenging compared to 2D, mainly due to the increased number of neural network parameters, the larger memory requirement and the limited amount of available training data. Current SISR methods for 3D volumetric images are based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), especially Wasserstein GANs due to their training stability. Other common architectures in the 2D domain, e.g. transformer models, require large amounts of training data and are therefore not suitable for the limited 3D data. However, Wasserstein GANs can be problematic because they may not converge to a global optimum and thus produce blurry results. Here, we propose a new method for 3D SR based on the GAN framework. Specifically, we use instance noise to balance the GAN training. Furthermore, we use a relativistic GAN loss function and an updating feature extractor during the training process. We show that our method produces highly accurate results. We also show that we need very few training samples. In particular, we need less than 30 samples instead of thousands of training samples that are typically required in previous studies.

Deep learning-based image restoration has emerged as a promising solution capable of generating high-resolution and motion-artifact-free MRI images from low-resolution images acquired with shortened acquisition times or from motion-artifact-corrupted images. To facilitate clinical integration, a time- and GPU-efficient network with reliable accuracy is essential. In this study, we adopted a unified 2D deep learning framework for pseudo-3D MRI image super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) and motion artifact reduction (MAR). The optimal down-sampling factors to optimize the acquisition time in SRR were identified. Training for MAR was performed using publicly available in vivo data, employing a novel standardized method to induce motion artifacts of varying severity in a controlled way. The accuracy of the network was evaluated through a pixel-wise uncertainty map, and performance was benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods.

In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), for example, such methods can facilitate reductions in data-acquisition times. Deep learning-based methods hold potential for learning object priors or constraints that can serve to mitigate the effects of data-incompleteness on image reconstruction. One line of emerging research involves formulating an optimization-based reconstruction method in the latent space of a generative deep neural network. However, when generative adversarial networks (GANs) are employed, such methods can result in image reconstruction errors if the sought-after solution does not reside within the range of the GAN. To circumvent this problem, in this work, a framework for reconstructing images from incomplete measurements is proposed that is formulated in the latent space of invertible neural network-based generative models. A novel regularization strategy is introduced that takes advantage of the multiscale architecture of certain invertible neural networks, which can result in improved reconstruction performance over classical methods in terms of traditional metrics. The proposed method is investigated for reconstructing images from undersampled MRI data.

However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML) models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples. In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising results to optimize the defect localization process.",2025-08-28T10:00:23Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20612v1
http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26635v2,SAMRI: Segment Anything Model for MRI,"Accurate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation is crucial for clinical decision-making, but remains labor-intensive when performed manually. Convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods can be accurate and efficient but often generalize poorly to MRI variable contrast, intensity inhomogeneity, and sequences. Although the transformer-based Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable generalizability in natural images, existing adaptations often treat MRI as another imaging modality, overlooking these modality-specific challenges. We present SAMRI, an MRI-specialized SAM trained and validated on 1.1 million labeled MR slices spanning whole-body organs and pathologies. We demonstrate that SAM can be effectively adapted to MRI by fine-tuning its mask decoder using a two-stage strategy, reducing training time by 94 percent and trainable parameters by 96 percent compared to full-model retraining. Across diverse MRI segmentation tasks, SAMRI achieves a mean Dice of 0.87, delivering state-of-the-art accuracy across anatomical regions and robust generalization on unseen structures, particularly small clinically important structures. In addition, we provide a complete training-to-inference pipeline and a user-friendly local graphical interface that enables interactive application of pretrained SAMRI models on standard machines, facilitating practical deployment for real-world MRI segmentation.",2025-10-30T16:04:00Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26635v2
http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16175v1,Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Modeling the Martian Induced Magnetosphere,"Understanding the magnetic field environment around Mars and its response to upstream solar wind conditions provide key insights into the processes driving atmospheric ion escape. To date, global models of Martian induced magnetosphere have been exclusively physics-based, relying on computationally intensive simulations. For the first time, we develop a data-driven model of the Martian induced magnetospheric magnetic field using Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) combined with MAVEN observations and physical laws. Trained under varying solar wind conditions, including B_IMF, P_SW, and θ_cone, the data-driven model accurately reconstructs the three-dimensional magnetic field configuration and its variability in response to upstream solar wind drivers. Based on the PINN results, we identify key dependencies of magnetic field configuration on solar wind parameters, including the hemispheric asymmetries of the draped field line strength in the Mars-Solar-Electric coordinates. These findings demonstrate the capability of PINNs to reconstruct complex magnetic field structures in the Martian induced magnetosphere, thereby offering a promising tool for advancing studies of solar wind-Mars interactions.",2025-12-18T04:49:20Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16175v1
http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15390v1,Learned Primal Dual Splitting for Self-Supervised Noise-Adaptive MRI Reconstruction,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction has largely been dominated by deep neural networks (DNN); however, many state-of-the-art architectures use black-box structures, which hinder interpretability and improvement. Here, we propose an interpretable DNN architecture for self-supervised MRI reconstruction and denoising by directly parameterizing and learning the classical primal-dual splitting, dubbed LPDSNet. This splitting algorithm allows us to decouple the observation model from the signal prior. Experimentally, we show other interpretable architectures without this decoupling property exhibit failure in the self-supervised learning regime. We report state-of-the-art self-supervised joint MRI reconstruction and denoising performance and novel noise-level generalization capabilities, where in contrast black-box networks fail to generalize.",2025-04-21T18:57:49Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15390v1
http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18365v1,Brightness-Invariant Tracking Estimation in Tagged MRI,"Magnetic resonance (MR) tagging is an imaging technique for noninvasively tracking tissue motion in vivo by creating a visible pattern of magnetization saturation (tags) that deforms with the tissue. Due to longitudinal relaxation and progression to steady-state, the tags and tissue brightnesses change over time, which makes tracking with optical flow methods error-prone. Although Fourier methods can alleviate these problems, they are also sensitive to brightness changes as well as spectral spreading due to motion. To address these problems, we introduce the brightness-invariant tracking estimation (BRITE) technique for tagged MRI. BRITE disentangles the anatomy from the tag pattern in the observed tagged image sequence and simultaneously estimates the Lagrangian motion. The inherent ill-posedness of this problem is addressed by leveraging the expressive power of denoising diffusion probabilistic models to represent the probabilistic distribution of the underlying anatomy and the flexibility of physics-informed neural networks to estimate biologically-plausible motion. A set of tagged MR images of a gel phantom was acquired with various tag periods and imaging flip angles to demonstrate the impact of brightness variations and to validate our method. The results show that BRITE achieves more accurate motion and strain estimates as compared to other state of the art methods, while also being resistant to tag fading.",2025-05-23T20:48:23Z,https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18365v1
