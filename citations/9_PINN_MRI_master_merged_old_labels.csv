Fitting the observed data with multi-compartment exchange models is desirable, as they are physiologically plausible and resolve directly for blood flow and microvascular function. However, the reliability of model fitting is limited by the low signal-to-noise ratio, temporal resolution, and acquisition length. This may result in inaccurate parameter estimates. This study introduces physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) as a means to perform myocardial perfusion MR quantification, which provides a versatile scheme for the inference of kinetic parameters. These neural networks can be trained to fit the observed perfusion MR data while respecting the underlying physical conservation laws described by a multi-compartment exchange model. Here, we provide a framework for the implementation of PINNs in myocardial perfusion MR. The approach is validated both in silico and in vivo. In the in silico study, an overall decrease in mean-squared error with the ground-truth parameters was observed compared to a standard non-linear least squares fitting approach. The in vivo study demonstrates that the method produces parameter values comparable to those previously found in literature, as well as providing parameter maps which match the clinical diagnosis of patients.",perfusion,perfusion_quantification,tracer_kinetics,physics_CNN_UNet,in_vivo_patients,"Uses DSC-MRI with tracer kinetics PDE in CNN loss, validated on patients."

We proposed incorporating flow rate constraints to ensure physical consistency across cross-sections. The proposed framework included optimization strategies to improve convergence, stability, and accuracy. Artificial viscosity modeling, projecting conflicting gradients (PCGrad), and Euclidean norm scaling were applied to balance loss functions during training.

MREPT is a noninvasive technique that can retrieve the spatial distribution of electrical properties (EPs) of scanned tissues from measured transmit radiofrequency (RF) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems. The reconstruction of EP values in MREPT is achieved by solving a partial differential equation derived from Maxwell's equations that lacks a direct solution. Most conventional MREPT methods suffer from artifacts caused by the invalidation of the assumption applied for simplification of the problem and numerical errors caused by numerical differentiation. Existing deep learning-based (DL-based) MREPT methods comprise data-driven methods that need to collect massive datasets for training or model-driven methods that are only validated in trivial cases. Hence we proposed a model-driven method that learns mapping from a measured RF, its spatial gradient and Laplacian to EPs using fully connected networks (FCNNs). The spatial gradient of EP can be computed through the automatic differentiation of FCNNs and the chain rule. FCNNs are optimized using the residual of the central physical equation of convection-reaction MREPT as the loss function ( L). To alleviate the ill condition of the problem, we added multiconstraints, including the similarity constraint between permittivity and conductivity and the l1 norm of spatial gradients of permittivity and conductivity, to the L . We demonstrate the proposed method with a three-dimensional realistic head model, a digital phantom simulation, and a practical phantom experiment at a 9.4T animal MRI system.",MREPT,EPT,Maxwell_MREPT,PINN_MLP,mix,"Uses modified PINN (FCNN) with Maxwell-derived PDE for electrical property tomography, validated on phantoms."

In this work, we put forth a  physics-informed deep learning framework that augments sparse clinical  measurements with one-dimensional (1D) reduced-order model (ROM) simulations to  generate physically consistent brain hemodynamic parameters with high  spatiotemporal resolution. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound is one of the  most common techniques in the current clinical workflow that enables noninvasive  and instantaneous evaluation of blood flow velocity within the cerebral  arteries. However, it is spatially limited to only a handful of locations across  the cerebrovasculature due to the constrained accessibility through the skull's  acoustic windows. Our deep learning framework uses in vivo real-time TCD  velocity measurements at several locations in the brain combined with baseline  vessel cross-sectional areas acquired from 3D angiography images and provides  high-resolution maps of velocity, area, and pressure in the entire brain  vasculature. We validate the predictions of our model against in vivo velocity  measurements obtained via four-dimensional (4D) flow magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) scans. We then showcase the clinical significance of this technique in  diagnosing cerebral vasospasm (CVS) by successfully predicting the changes in  vasospastic local vessel diameters based on corresponding sparse velocity  measurements. We show this capability by generating synthetic blood flow data  after cerebral vasospasm at various levels of stenosis.

However, these  metrics have low discriminate power to distinguish different cardiomyopathies,  which may not affect the global function of the heart. Quantifying local  deformations in the form of cardiac strain can provide helpful information, but  it remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce WarpPINN, a physics-informed  neural network to perform image registration to obtain local metrics of heart  deformation. We apply this method to cine magnetic resonance images to estimate  the motion during the cardiac cycle. We inform our neural network of the  near-incompressibility of cardiac tissue by penalizing the Jacobian of the  deformation field. The loss function has two components: an intensity-based  similarity term between the reference and the warped template images, and a  regularizer that represents the hyperelastic behavior of the tissue. The  architecture of the neural network allows us to easily compute the strain via  automatic differentiation to assess cardiac activity. We use Fourier feature  mappings to overcome the spectral bias of neural networks, allowing us to  capture discontinuities in the strain field. The algorithm is tested on  synthetic examples and on a cine SSFP MRI benchmark of 15 healthy volunteers,  where it is trained to learn the deformation mapping of each case. We outperform  current methodologies in landmark tracking and provide physiological strain  estimations in the radial and circumferential directions.

The simulation study investigated the differences between the predicted and ground‐truth values and their variations with the noise level. The in vivo study evaluated the predicted values from the original images and noise‐induced variations in the predicted values from the synthesized noisy images by adding Rician noise to the original images. The simulation study showed that CBF estimated using the supervised DNN was not biased by noise, whereas that estimated using other methods had a positive bias. Although the ATT with all methods exhibited a similar behavior with noise increase, the ATT with the supervised DNN was less biased. The in vivo study showed that CBF and ATT with the supervised DNN were the most accurate and that the supervised and unsupervised DNNs had the highest noise immunity in CBF and ATT estimations, respectively.

Thus, removing noise  becomes important for high b-value DWI images. Here, we propose a  Physics-Informed neural Network for high b-value DWI images Denoising (PIND) by  leveraging information from physics-informed loss and prior information from low  b-value DWI images with high signal-to-noise ratio. Experiments are conducted on  a prostate DWI dataset that has 125 subjects.

METHODS: We extended a recently proposed physics-informed 2D U-Net that learns  spatio-temporal slices (named XT-YT U-Net), and employed it for the task of  uncertainty quantification (UQ) by using Monte Carlo dropout and a Gaussian  negative log-likelihood loss function. Our data comprised 2D dynamic MR images  acquired with a radial balanced steady-state free precession sequence.

The concentration of  ferric ions can be measured using various techniques, including magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI) or spectrophotometry. While Fricke gels offer several  advantages, a significant hurdle to their widespread application is the  diffusion of ferric ions within the gel matrix. This phenomenon leads to a  blurring of the dose distribution over time, compromising the accuracy of dose  measurements. To mitigate the issue of ferric ion diffusion, researchers have  explored various strategies such as the incorporation of additives or  modification of the gel composition to either reduce the mobility of ferric ions  or stabilize the gel matrix. The computational method proposed leverages the  power of artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, to mitigate the  effects of ferric ion diffusion that can compromise measurement precision. By  employing Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), the method introduces a  novel way to apply physical laws directly within the learning process,  optimizing the network to adhere to the principles governing ion diffusion. This  is particularly advantageous for solving the partial differential equations that  describe the diffusion process in 2D and 3D. By inputting the spatial  distribution of ferric ions at a given time, along with boundary conditions and  the diffusion coefficient, the model can backtrack to accurately reconstruct the  original ion distribution. This capability is crucial for enhancing the fidelity  of 3D spatial dose measurements, ensuring that the data reflect the true dose  distribution without the artifacts introduced by ion migration. Here,  multidimensional models able to handle 2D and 3D data were developed and tested  against dose distributions numerically evolved in time from 20 to 100 h. The  results in terms of various metrics show a significant agreement in both 2D and  3D dose distributions. In particular, the mean square error of the prediction  spans the range 1×10-6-1×10-4, while the gamma analysis results in a 90-100%  passing rate with 3%/2 mm, depending on the elapsed time, the type of  distribution modeled and the dimensionality. This method could expand the  applicability of Fricke gel dosimeters to a wider range of measurement tasks,  from simple planar dose assessments to intricate volumetric analyses. The  proposed technique holds great promise for overcoming the limitations imposed by  ion diffusion in Fricke gel dosimeters.",reconstruction,reconstruction,diffusion,PINN_MLP,simulation,PINNs correct ferric ion diffusion in Fricke gel dosimeters measured via MRI.

Previous deep learning SR approaches have generated low-resolution training  images by simple k-space truncation, but this does not properly model in-plane  turbo spin echo (TSE) MRI resolution degradation, which has variable T2  relaxation effects in different k-space regions. To fill this gap, we developed  a T2 -deblurred deep learning SR method for the SR of 3D-TSE images. METHODS: A SR generative adversarial network was trained using physically  realistic resolution degradation (asymmetric T2 weighting of raw high-resolution  k-space data). For comparison, we trained the same network structure on previous  degradation models without TSE physics modeling. We tested all models for both  retrospective and prospective SR with 3 × 3 acceleration factor (in the two  phase-encoding directions) of genetically engineered mouse embryo model TSE-MR  images. RESULTS: The proposed method can produce high-quality 3 × 3 SR images for a  typical 500-slice volume with 6-7 mouse embryos. Because 3 × 3 SR was performed,  the image acquisition time can be reduced from 15 h to 1.7 h. Compared to  previous SR methods without TSE modeling, the proposed method achieved the best  quantitative imaging metrics for both retrospective and prospective evaluations  and achieved the best imaging-quality expert scores for prospective evaluation.

However,  cerebral blood flow (CBF) estimation in infants using ASL remains challenging  due to the complex interplay of network physiology, involving dynamic  interactions between cardiac output and cerebral perfusion, as well as issues  with parameter uncertainty and data noise. We propose a new spatial  uncertainty-based physics-informed neural network (PINN), SUPINN, to estimate  CBF and other parameters from infant ASL data.

However, long acquisition times and cumbersome data  analysis limit widespread availability. Purpose To evaluate the feasibility and  accuracy of a generative artificial intelligence (AI) approach (fluid  physics-informed cycle generative adversarial network [FPI-CycleGAN]) in  quantifying aorta hemodynamics directly from anatomic input as an alternative to  4D flow MRI. Materials and Methods Patients were retrospectively identified from  a dataset of clinical cardiothoracic MRI examinations performed between November  2011 and July 2020. All patients underwent aortic 4D flow MRI, which served as a  reference standard for training and testing of FPI-CycleGANs. A  three-dimensional (3D) segmentation of the aortic geometry was used as the only  input to predict systolic aortic hemodynamics, with separate networks for  bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) (994 in the training set and 248 in the test set)  and tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) (419 in the training set and 104 in the test  set). Voxel-by-voxel and regional analyses were used to quantify and compare (AI  vs the reference standard, 4D flow) systolic velocity vector fields, peak  velocity, wall shear stress (WSS), and classification of aortic valve stenosis.  Results In total, 1765 patients (median age, 53 years [IQR, 41-63 years]; 1242  patients had BAV and 523 had TAV) were included. Mean AI computation time was  0.15 second ± 0.11 (SD), and total training was 1500 and 3600 minutes for the  TAV and BAV networks, respectively. The FPI-CycleGAN predicted systolic 3D  velocity vector fields accurately, with low bias (<0.01 m/sec) and excellent  limits of agreements (±0.06-0.08 m/sec). For peak velocities and WSS, there was  strong agreement between FPI-CycleGAN and 4D flow (r2 = 0.930-0.957 [P < .001],  with relative differences of 6.2%-9.8%). AI accurately classified aortic valve  stenosis severity in 85.8% of patients (302 of 352) (κ = 0.80 [95% CI: 0.71,  0.89]). The FPI-CycleGAN was robust to one- and two-voxel dilation and erosion  (bias, -0.05 to 0.1 m/sec) and ±5° rotation (bias, -0.02 to 0.03 m/sec) of the  input data. The application of the trained FPI-CycleGAN in an external test set  with contrast-enhanced MR angiography (n = 60 patients) as AI input data  demonstrated strong to excellent performance for peak velocities and WSS (r2 =  0.944-0.965 [P < .001], with relative differences of 6.2%-9.2%).

A key  component of the latter is that they allow for physics-informed learning of the  regularization method, which is parametrized by the NN. However, due to the lack  of understanding of deep NNs from a theoretical point of view, unrolled NNs are  still black-boxes when the regularizers are given by deep NNs, for example,  U-Nets. PURPOSE: Dictionarylearning (DL) is a well-established regularization method,  which is based on learning a transform to sparsely approximate the signals of  interest. Typically, DL-based image reconstruction either employs a dictionary,  which was pretrained on a set of patches which were extracted from ground-truth  images or a dictionary which is jointly trained during the reconstruction.  However, in both cases, the used DL-algorithms are not designed to take into  account the reconstruction problem or the underlying physical model, which  describes the imaging process. In this work, we propose a DL-algorithm based on  unrolled NNs to overcome these limitations. METHODS: We construct an unrolled NN, which corresponds to an unrolled DL-based  reconstruction algorithm and train the unrolled NN to optimize its weights, that  is, the atoms of the dictionary, by back-propagation in a supervised manner.  Further, we propose a new way to employ a 2D dictionary in the spatio-temporal  domain. We tested and evaluated the method on an accelerated cardiac cine MR  image reconstruction problem using 216/36/36 dynamic images for training,  validation, and testing and compared it to two well-known state-of-the-art  approaches for cardiac cine MRI based on deep iterative CNNs. Further, we  analyze the obtained dictionaries in terms of dictionary-coherence and structure  of the atoms. Last, we compare the reported methods in terms of stability by  applying them to an entirely different dataset consisting of 49 different  test images. RESULTS: The investigated physics-informed DL-approach yields significantly more  accurate reconstructions compared to the DL-method, which uses dictionaries  obtained by decoupled pretraining, thereby providing an improvement of up to  4.90 dB in terms of PSNR and 5% in terms of SSIM. Further, the proposed  spatio-temporal 2D dictionary outperforms the 1D and 3D dictionaries by  preventing smoothing of image details while still accurately removing  undersampling artifacts and noise resulting in an increase of up to 1.10 dB in  terms of PSNR and 4% in terms of SSIM. Although being surpassed by the CNNs on  the first dataset, the proposed NNs-based DL method is more stable compared to  the latter approach and yields comparable results on the second dataset. Last,  it has the advantage of being entirely interpretable in each component.

It plays a pivotal role in high-level brain functions such  as memory, emotion, and sensation. However, the specific form of molecular  transport within the ECS remain elusive. To address this challenge, this paper  proposes a novel approach to quantitatively analyze the molecular transport  within the ECS by solving an inverse problem derived from the  advection-diffusion equation (ADE) using a physics-informed neural network  (PINN). PINN provides a streamlined solution to the ADE without the need for  intricate mathematical formulations or grid settings. Additionally, the  optimization of PINN facilitates the automatic computation of the diffusion  coefficient governing long-term molecule transport and the velocity of molecules  driven by advection. Consequently, the proposed method allows for the  quantitative analysis and identification of the specific pattern of molecular  transport within the ECS through the calculation of the Péclet number.  Experimental validation on two datasets of magnetic resonance images (MRIs)  captured at different time points showcases the effectiveness of the proposed  method.

Image-based assessment using  phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging has particular promise for  non-invasive full-field mapping of cerebrovascular hemodynamics. However,  estimations are complicated by the narrow and tortuous intracranial vasculature,  with accurate image-based quantification directly dependent on sufficient  spatial resolution. Further, extended scan times are required for  high-resolution acquisitions, and most clinical acquisitions are performed at  comparably low resolution (>1 mm) where biases have been observed with regard to  the quantification of both flow and relative pressure.

The squared L2 norm loss was  complemented by two distinct physics models to define two 'Physics-Informed'  loss functions: Cycling Loss 1 embedded a mono-exponential model to describe the  relaxation of water protons, while Cycling Loss 2 incorporated the EPG theory  with slice profile to model the magnetization dephasing under the effect of  gradients and RF pulses. The Myo-DINO was trained with the hyperparameter value  of the 'Physics-Informed' component held constant, i.e. λmodel = 1, while  different hyperparameter values (λcnn) were applied to the squared L2 norm  component in both the cycling loss. In particular, hard (λcnn=10), normal  (λcnn=1) and self-supervised (λcnn=0) constraints were applied to gradually  decrease the impact of the squared L2 norm component on the 'Physics Informed'  term during the Myo-DINO training process. Myo-DINO achieved higher performance  with Cycling Loss 2 for FF, wT2 and B1 prediction. In particular, high  reconstruction similarity and quality (Structural Similarity Index > 0.92, Peak  Signal to Noise ratio > 30.0 db) and small reconstruction error (Normalized Root  Mean Squared Error < 0.038) to the reference maps were shown with  self-supervised weighting of the Cycling Loss 2. In addition muscle-wise FF, wT2  and B1 predicted values showed good agreement with the reference values. The  Myo-DINO has been demonstrated to be a robust and efficient workflow for MR  parameters mapping in the context of mMRI. This provides preliminary evidence  that it can be an effective alternative to the reference post-processing  algorithm. In addition, our results demonstrate that Cycling Loss 2, which  incorporates the Extended Phase Graph (EPG) model, provides the most robust and  relevant physical constraints for Myo-DINO in this multi-parameter regression  task. The use of Cycling Loss 2 with self-supervised constraint improved the  explainability of the learning process because the network acquired domain  knowledge solely in accordance with the assumptions of the EPG model.",qMRI_relaxometry,parameter_mapping,Bloch,physics_CNN_UNet,in_vivo_patients,Myo-DINO uses EPG-based loss for T2/Fat Fraction mapping in neuromuscular disorders.

METHOD: In simulations (signal-to-noise ratio [SNR] = 20), the accuracy,  independence, and consistency of IVIM-NET were evaluated for combinations of  hyperparameters (fit S0, constraints, network architecture, number of hidden  layers, dropout, batch normalization, learning rate), by calculating the  normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE), Spearman's ρ, and the coefficient of  variation (CVNET ), respectively. The best performing network, IVIM-NEToptim was  compared to least squares (LS) and a Bayesian approach at different SNRs.  IVIM-NEToptim 's performance was evaluated in an independent dataset of 23  patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Fourteen of the patients  received no treatment between two repeated scan sessions and nine received  chemoradiotherapy between the repeated sessions.

Therefore, we aimed to develop  simulation-based DNNs for MP-ASL and compared the performance of a supervised  DNN (DNNSup), physics-informed unsupervised DNN (DNNUns), and the conventional  lookup table method (LUT) using simulation and in vivo data. METHODS: MP-ASL was performed twice during resting state and once during the  breath-holding task. First, the accuracy and noise immunity were evaluated in  the first resting state. Second, CBF and CBVa values were statistically compared  between the first resting state and the breath-holding task using the Wilcoxon  signed-rank test and Cliff's delta. Finally, reproducibility of the two resting  states was assessed. RESULTS: Simulation and first resting-state analyses demonstrated that DNNSup  had higher accuracy, noise immunity, and a six-fold faster computation time than  LUT.

However, extensive experimentation has revealed that these  models are prone to generating artifacts due to the inherent randomness involved  in generating images from pure noise. To achieve more controlled image  reconstruction, we reexamine the concept of interpolatable physical priors in  k-space data, focusing specifically on the interpolation of high-frequency (HF)  k-space data from low-frequency (LF) k-space data. Broadly, this insight drives  a shift in the generation paradigm from random noise to a more deterministic  approach grounded in the existing LF k-space data. Building on this, we first  establish a relationship between the interpolation of HF k-space data from LF  k-space data and the reverse heat diffusion process, providing a fundamental  framework for designing diffusion models that generate missing HF data. To  further improve reconstruction accuracy, we integrate a traditional  physics-informed k-space interpolation model into our diffusion framework as a  data fidelity term. Experimental validation using publicly available datasets  demonstrates that our approach significantly surpasses traditional k-space  interpolation methods, deep learning-based k-space interpolation techniques, and  conventional diffusion models, particularly in HF regions.

In this manuscript  Classifying AD using a finite basis physics neural network (CAD-FBPINN) is  proposed. Initially, images are collected from AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)  dataset. The images are fed to Pre-processing segment. During the preprocessing  phase the reverse lognormal Kalman filter (RLKF) is used to enhance the input  images.

Materials and Methods  This retrospective study introduces PIA, an emerging self-supervised deep  learning model that integrates a three-compartment diffusion-relaxation model  with hybrid multidimensional MRI. PIA was trained to encode the biophysical  model into a deep neural network to predict measurements of tissue-specific  biomarkers for PCa without extensive training data requirements. Comprehensive  in silico and in vivo experiments, using histopathology measurements as the  reference standard, were conducted to validate the model's efficacy in  comparison to the traditional nonlinear least squares (NLLS) algorithm. PIA's  robustness to noise was tested in in silico experiments with varying  signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, and in vivo performance for estimating  volume fractions was evaluated in 21 patients (mean age, 60 years ± 6.6 [SD];  all male) with PCa (71 regions of interest). Evaluation metrics included the  intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Pearson correlation coefficient.  Results PIA predicted the reference standard tissue parameters with high  accuracy, outperforming conventional NLLS methods, especially under noisy  conditions (rs = 0.80 vs 0.65, P < .001 for epithelium volume at SNR of 20:1).  In in vivo validation, PIA's noninvasive volume fraction estimates matched  quantitative histology (ICC, 0.94, 0.85, and 0.92 for epithelium, stroma, and  lumen compartments, respectively; P < .001 for all). PIA's measurements strongly  correlated with PCa aggressiveness (r = 0.75, P < .001). Furthermore, PIA ran  10 000 faster than NLLS (0.18 second vs 40 minutes per image). Conclusion PIA  provided accurate prostate tissue biomarker measurements from MRI data with  better robustness to noise and computational efficiency compared with the NLLS  algorithm.

The technique, which stems from the principle of minimum  potential energy in solid mechanics, consists of two steps: Firstly, in the  predictor step, the geometric registration is achieved by minimizing a loss  function composed of a dissimilarity measure and a regularizing term. Secondly,  the physics of the problem, including the equilibrium equations along with  growth mechanics, are enforced in a corrector step by minimizing the potential  energy corresponding to a Dirichlet problem, where the predictor solution  defines the boundary condition and is maintained by distance functions. The  features of the new solution procedure, as well as the nature of the  registration problem, are highlighted by considering several examples. In  particular, registration problems containing large non-uniform deformations  caused by extension, shearing, and bending of multiply-connected regions are  used as benchmarks. In addition, we analyzed a benchmark biological example  (registration for brain data) to showcase that the new deep learning method  competes with available methods in the literature. We then applied the method to  various datasets. First, we analyze the regrowth of the zebrafish embryonic fin  from confocal imaging data. Next, we evaluate the quality of the solution  procedure for two examples related to the brain. For one, we apply the new  method for 3D image registration of longitudinal magnetic resonance images of  the brain to assess cerebral atrophy, where a first-order ODE describes the  volume loss mechanism.

W00044,A physics-informed deep learning model for MRI brain motion correction,"Safari M, Wang S, Eidex Z, Qiu RLJ, Chang CW, Yu DS, Yang X.",2025,journal,Med Phys,,,10.1002/mp.70197,41395855.0,,,PubMed,"BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an essential brain imaging tool,  but its long acquisition times make it highly susceptible to motion artifacts  that can degrade diagnostic quality. PURPOSE: This work aims to develop and evaluate a novel physics-informed motion  correction network, termed PI-MoCoNet, which leverages complementary information  from both the spatial and k-space domains. The primary goal is to robustly  remove motion artifacts from high-resolution brain MRI images without explicit  motion parameter estimation, thereby preserving image fidelity and enhancing  diagnostic reliability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PI-MoCoNet is designed as a dual-network framework  consisting of a motion detection network and a motion correction network. The  motion detection network employs a U-net architecture to identify corrupted  k-space lines using a spatial averaging module, thereby reducing prediction  uncertainty. The correction network, inspired by recent advances in U-net  architectures and incorporating Swin Transformer blocks, reconstructs  motion-corrected images by leveraging three loss components: the reconstruction  loss ( L1 ), a learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) loss, and a  data consistency loss ( Ldc ) that enforces fidelity in the k-space domain.  Realistic motion artifacts were simulated by perturbing phase encoding lines  with random rigid transformations. The method was evaluated on two public  datasets (IXI and MR-ART). Comparative assessments were made against baseline  models, including Pix2Pix GAN, CycleGAN, and a conventional U-net, using  quantitative metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio(PSNR), structural  similarity index measure (SSIM), and normalized mean square error (NMSE). RESULTS: PI-MoCoNet demonstrated significant improvements over competing methods  across all levels of motion artifacts. On the IXI dataset, for minor motion  artifacts, PSNR improved from 34.15 dB in the motion-corrupted images to 45.95  dB after correction, SSIM increased from 0.87 to 1.00, and NMSE was reduced from  0.55% to 0.04%. For moderate artifacts, PSNR increased from 30.23 to 42.16 dB,  SSIM from 0.80 to 0.99, and NMSE from 1.32% to 0.09%. In the case of heavy  artifacts, PSNR improved from 27.99 to 36.01 dB, SSIM from 0.75 to 0.97, and  NMSE decreased from 2.21% to 0.36%. On the MR-ART dataset, PSNR values increased  from 23.15 to 33.01 dB for low artifact levels and from 21.23 to 31.72 dB for  high artifact levels; concurrently, SSIM improved from 0.72 to 0.87 and from  0.63 to 0.83, while NMSE decreased from 10.08% to 6.24% and from 14.77% to  8.32%, respectively. An ablation study further confirmed that incorporating both  data consistency and perceptual losses led to an approximate 1 dB gain in PSNR  and a reduction of 0.17% in NMSE compared to using the reconstruction loss  alone. CONCLUSIONS: PI-MoCoNet is a robust, physics-informed framework for mitigating  brain motion artifacts in MRI. By successfully integrating spatial and k-space  information, it enhances image quality and reduces the likelihood of repeat  imaging sessions due to motion-induced degradation. Its superior performance  compared to existing methods underscores its clinical applicability, especially  in scenarios where patient motion is inevitable, thus improving patient comfort,  diagnostic reliability, and overall treatment planning efficiency.",reconstruction,reconstruction,Bloch,physics_CNN_UNet,mix,PI-MoCoNet uses physics-informed spatial/k-space consistency losses for motion artifact correction in dynamic MRI.

Hence, to improve parameter  map quality of tri-exponential IVIM, we developed an unsupervised  physics-informed deep neural network (IVIM3-NET). We assessed its performance in  simulations and in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and  compared outcomes with bi-exponential LSQ and NN fits and tri-exponential LSQ  fits. Scanning was performed using a 3.0T free-breathing multi-slice  diffusion-weighted single-shot echo-planar imaging sequence with 18 b-values.  Images were analysed for visual quality, comparing the bi- and tri-exponential  IVIM models for LSQ fits and NN fits using parameter-map signal-to-noise ratios  (SNR) and adjusted R 2.

In 33 out of 36 patients, the tri-exponential  model exhibited higher adjusted R 2 values than the bi-exponential model.

This can produce physically implausible deformations, such as  tissue folding, and creates a trade-off between registration accuracy and  anatomical correctness. The objective of this study is to develop and validate a  novel, physics-informed regularizer that simultaneously improves both the  accuracy and physical plausibility of learning-based registration with  negligible computational overhead. METHODS: We propose ElasticMorph, a plug-and-play loss function derived from the  Navier-Cauchy equation. This regularizer penalizes both curvature and divergence  in the deformation field. We derive an approximation based, measure theoretic  bound under small strain assumptions, which links the elastic residual to an  upper bound on the number of negative Jacobian voxels. This gives a principled  and differentiable surrogate for folding control. The method was evaluated on  two public brain MRI benchmarks (IXI and LPBA-40) by integrating it into four  state-of-the-art CNN and transformer backbones. Performance was quantified using  the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and the percentage of negative Jacobians  (%negJ), with statistical significance assessed via paired t-tests. RESULTS: Across all tested backbones and datasets, ElasticMorph consistently  improved registration accuracy, increasing the mean DSC by 0.56-4.92 %.  Concurrently, it suppressed folding artifacts, reducing the %negJ by 24%-42%.  This was achieved with a minimal increase in training time ≤8% and memory ≤15%,  and no cost at inference. Ablation studies confirmed that the combined  curvature-divergence loss outperformed either component alone. A hyperparameter  sweep revealed a broad optimal range, with folding artifacts monotonically  decreasing as regularization strength increased, consistent with our theoretical  proof. CONCLUSIONS: Enforcing second-order linear elasticity offers a robust and  computationally efficient strategy to overcome the limitations of conventional  regularizers. ElasticMorph provides a practical, principled, and plug-and-play  solution for developing more accurate and physically plausible registration  models, holding significant potential for improving the reliability of  downstream biomedical image analysis tasks. The code will be made publicly  available.",other_MRI,motion_registration,elasticity,unrolled,in_vivo_volunteers,ElasticMorph adds second-order Navier-Cauchy elastic regularization to CNN/transformer backbones for brain MRI registration.

METHODS: The novel method (""UNet+JE"") combines an existing neural network  (""UNetmag"") with a physics-informed algorithm for jointly estimating motion  parameters and the motion-compensated image (""JE""). UNetmag and UNet+JE were  trained on two training datasets separately with different distributions of  motion corruption severity and compared to JE as a benchmark. All five resulting  methods were tested on T1w 3D MPRAGE scans of healthy participants with  simulated (n = 40) and in vivo (n = 10) motion corruption ranging from mild to  severe motion. RESULTS: UNet+JE provided better motion correction than UNetmag ( p < 10-2 for  all metrics for both simulated and in vivo data), under both training datasets.  UNetmag exhibited residual image artifacts and blurring, as well as greater  susceptibility to data distribution shifts than UNet+JE.

Precise material properties derived from patient-specific CT scans are essential for simulations to accurately mimic real-life scenarios, which is invaluable in creating effective surgical plans. The integration of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offers significant clinical benefits by automating lumbar spine segmentation and meshing. Methods We developed a FEA model of the lumbar spine incorporating detailed anatomical and material properties derived from high-quality CT and MRI scans.

Accelerating MRI through undersampling k-space data leads to ill-posed inverse problems, introducing noise and artifacts that degrade image quality. Conventional deep learning models, including conditional and unconditional approaches, often face challenges in generalization, particularly with variations in imaging operators or domain shifts. In this study, we propose PINN-DADif, a Physics-Informed Neural Network integrated with deep adaptive diffusion priors, to address these challenges in MRI reconstruction. PINN-DADif employs a two-phase inference strategy: an initial rapid-diffusion phase for fast preliminary reconstructions, followed by an adaptive phase where the diffusion prior is refined to ensure consistency with MRI physics and data fidelity. The inclusion of physics-based regularization through PINNs enhances the model's adherence to k-space constraints and gradient smoothness, leading to more accurate reconstructions. This adaptive approach reduces the number of iterations required compared to traditional diffusion models, improving both speed and image quality. We validated PINN-DADif on a private MRI dataset and the public fastMRI dataset, where it outperformed state-of-the-art methods. The model achieved PSNR values of 41.2, 39.5, and 41.5, and SSIM values of 98.7, 98.0, and 98.5 for T1, T2, and Proton Density-weighted images at R = 4x on the private dataset.

However, its application to imaging bolus movement through the esophagus has only been demonstrated in few feasibility studies and is relatively unexplored. In this work, we present a computational framework called mechanics-informed MRI (MRI-MECH) that enhances that capability, thereby increasing the applicability of dynamic MRI for diagnosing esophageal disorders. Pineapple juice was used as the swallowed contrast material for the dynamic MRI, and the MRI image sequence was used as input to the MRI-MECH. The MRI-MECH modeled the esophagus as a flexible one-dimensional tube, and the elastic tube walls followed a linear tube law. Flow through the esophagus was governed by one-dimensional mass and momentum conservation equations. These equations were solved using a physics-informed neural network. The physics-informed neural network minimized the difference between the measurements from the MRI and model predictions and ensured that the physics of the fluid flow problem was always followed. MRI-MECH calculated the fluid velocity and pressure during esophageal transit and estimated the mechanical health of the esophagus by calculating wall stiffness and active relaxation. Additionally, MRI-MECH predicted missing information about the lower esophageal sphincter during the emptying process, demonstrating its applicability to scenarios with missing data or poor image resolution. In addition to potentially improving clinical decisions based on quantitative estimates of the mechanical health of the esophagus, MRI-MECH can also be adapted for application to other medical imaging modalities to enhance their functionality.

Magnetic resonance electrical properties tomography (MREPT) is a technique to non-invasively probe the EPs of tissues from MRI measurements. Most MREPT methods rely on numerical differentiation (ND) to solve partial differential Equations (PDEs) to reconstruct the EPs. However, they are not practical for clinical data because ND is noise sensitive and the MRI measurements for MREPT are noisy in nature. Recently, Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) have been introduced to solve PDEs by substituting ND with automatic differentiation (AD). To the best of our knowledge, it has not been applied to MREPT due to the challenges in using PINN on MREPT as (i) a PINN requires part of ground-truth EPs as collocation points to optimize the network’s AD, (ii) the noisy input data disrupts the optimization of PINNs despite the noise-filtering nature of NNs and additional denoising processes. In this work, we propose a PINN-MREPT model based on a canonical analytic MREPT model. A reference padding layer with known EPs was added to surround the region of interest for providing additive collocation points. Moreover, an optimizable diffusion coefficient was embedded in the analytic MREPT model used in the PINN-MREPT. The noise robustness of the proposed PINN-MREPT for single-sample reconstruction was tested by using numerical phantoms of human brain with extra tumor-like tissues at different noise levels. The results of numerical experiments show that PINN-MREPT outperforms two typical numerical MREPT methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy, sensitivity to the extra tissues, and the correlations of line profiles in the regions of interest. The advantage of the PINN-MREPT is shown by the results of an experiment on phantom measurement, too. Moreover, it is found that the diffusion term plays an important role to achieve a noise-robust PINN-MREPT. This is an important step moving forward to a clinical application of MREPT.
